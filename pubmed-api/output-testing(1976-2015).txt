102747|t|The pathology of experimental Ebola virus infection in monkeys.
102747|a|Six rhesus and two vervet monkeys were infected intraperitoneally with Ebola virus. They developed an acute haemorrhagic fever with skin rash 4 days later and died 6--12 days after infection. Histopathological lesions of acute necrosis were present in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs and testes. The presence of fibrin thrombi in several organs was suggestive of the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation during the infection.

106868|t|Ebola virus: a comparison, at ultrastructural level, of the behaviour of the Sudan and Zaire strains in monkeys.
106868|a|Histopathological and electron microscopical examination of human liver specimens collected during the Ebola haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan indicated that Zairean strains of the virus produced more extensive lesions. Experimental infection of rhesus monkeys wiht Zairean and Sudanese strains of Ebola virus produced similar changes to those found in man. In Zairean strain infections large numbers of virus particles were found in the liver, lung and spleen accompanied by extensive necrosis in the spleen. In Sudan strain infections particles were found only in the liver and in greatly reduced numbers. The main distinction lay in the high proportion of aberrant particles found with the Sudanese strain. The possibility of these being defective particles is discussed.

307455|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Sudan, 1976. Report of a WHO/International Study Team.
307455|a|A large outbreak of haemorrhagic fever (subsequently named Ebola haemorrhagic fever) occurred in southern Sudan between June and November 1976. There was a total of 284 cases; 67 in the source town of Nzara, 213 in Maridi, 3 in Tembura, and 1 in Juba. The outbreak in Nzara appears to have originated in the workers of a cotton factory. The disease in Maridi was amplified by transmission in a large, active hospital. Transmission of the disease required close contact with an acute case and was usually associated with the act of nursing a patient. The incubation period was between 7 and 14 days. Although the link was not well established, it appears that Nzara could have been the source of infection for a similar outbreak in the Bumba Zone of Zaire.In this outbreak Ebola haemorrhagic fever was a unique clinical disease with a high mortality rate (53% overall) and a prolonged recovery period in those who survived. Beginning with an influenza-like syndrome, including fever, headache, and joint and muscle pains, the disease soon caused diarrhoea (81%), vomiting (59%), chest pain (83%), pain and dryness of the throat (63%), and rash (52%). Haemorrhagic manifestations were common (71%), being present in half of the recovered cases and in almost all the fatal cases.Two post mortems were carried out on patients in November 1976. The histopathological findings resembled those of an acute viral infection and although the features were characteristic they were not exclusively diagnostic. They closely resembled the features described in Marburg virus infection, with focal eosinophilic necrosis in the liver and destruction of lymphocytes and their replacement by plasma cells. One case had evidence of renal tubular necrosis.Two strains of Ebola virus were isolated from acute phase sera collected from acutely ill patients in Maridi hospital during the investigation in November 1976. Antibodies to Ebola virus were detected by immunofluorescence in 42 of 48 patients in Maridi who had been diagnosed clinically, but in only 6 of 31 patients in Nzara. The possibility of the indirect immunofluorescent test not being sufficiently sensitive is discussed.Of Maridi case contacts, in hospital and in the local community, 19% had antibodies. Very few of them gave any history of illness, indicating that Ebola virus can cause mild or even subclinical infections. Of the cloth room workers in the Nzara cotton factory, 37% appeared to have been infected, suggesting that the factory may have been the prime source of infection.

307456|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire, 1976.
307456|a|Between 1 September and 24 October 1976, 318 cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Zaire. The outbreak was centred in the Bumba Zone of the Equateur Region and most of the cases were recorded within a radius of 70 km of Yambuku, although a few patients sought medical attention in Bumba, Abumombazi, and the capital city of Kinshasa, where individual secondary and tertiary cases occurred. There were 280 deaths, and only 38 serologically confirmed survivors.The index case in this outbreak had onset of symptoms on 1 September 1976, five days after receiving an injection of chloroquine for presumptive malaria at the outpatient clinic at Yambuku Mission Hospital (YMH). He had a clinical remission of his malaria symptoms. Within one week several other persons who had received injections at YMH also suffered from Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and almost all subsequent cases had either received injections at the hospital or had had close contact with another case. Most of these occurred during the first four weeks of the epidemic, after which time the hospital was closed, 11 of the 17 staff members having died of the disease. All ages and both sexes were affected, but women 15-29 years of age had the highest incidence of disease, a phenomenon strongly related to attendance at prenatal and outpatient clinics at the hospital where they received injections. The overall secondary attack rate was about 5%, although it ranged to 20% among close relatives such as spouses, parent or child, and brother or sister.Active surveillance disclosed that cases occurred in 55 of some 550 villages which were examined house-by-house. The disease was hitherto unknown to the people of the affected region. Intensive search for cases in the area of north-eastern Zaire between the Bumba Zone and the Sudan frontier near Nzara and Maridi failed to detect definite evidence of a link between an epidemic of the disease in that country and the outbreak near Bumba. Nevertheless it was established that people can and do make the trip between Nzara and Bumba in not more than four days: thus it was regarded as quite possible that an infected person had travelled from Sudan to Yambuku and transferred the virus to a needle of the hospital while receiving an injection at the outpatient clinic.Both the incubation period, and the duration of the clinical disease averaged about one week. After 3-4 days of non-specific symptoms and signs, patients typically experienced progressively severe sore throat, developed a maculopapular rash, had intractable abdominal pain, and began to bleed from multiple sites, principally the gastrointestinal tract. Although laboratory determinations were limited and not conclusive, it was concluded that pathogenesis of the disease included non-icteric hepatitis and possibly acute pancreatitis as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation.This syndrome was caused by a virus morphologically similar to Marburg virus, but immunologically distinct. It was named Ebola virus. The agent was isolated from the blood of 8 of 10 suspected cases using Vero cell cultures. Titrations of serial specimens obtained from one patient disclosed persistent viraemia of 10(6.5)-10(4.5) infectious units from the third day of illness until death on the eighth day. Ebola virus particles were found in formalin-

418537|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever: experimental infection of monkeys.
418537|a|Experimental infection of rhesus and vervet monkeys with Ebola virus produced a uniformly fatal illness. The course of the disease resembled that found in man with weight loss, anorexia, fever, haemorrhages and skin rash being frequently seen. Viraemia was obvious within two days of infection and persisted until death which occurred between days five and eight. Virus was found in high concentrations in several organs but particularly in the liver, spleen, and lungs.

1299611|t|The envelope glycoprotein of Ebola virus contains an immunosuppressive-like domain similar to oncogenic retroviruses.
1299611|a|Genomic RNA of a Zaire strain of Ebola virus was cloned, and cDNA inserts specific for the glycoprotein gene were isolated and sequenced. The determined sequence has only one open reading frame encoding 318 amino acids and is part of ORF-4 on the plus RNA strand. The putative transcriptional stop site (3' AAUUCUUUUU 5') and the transcriptional start site (3' AACUACUUCUAAUU..5') were identified. Computer-assisted comparison of the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal part of protein encoded by ORF-4 of Ebola virus with sequences of the proteins present in the SWISSPROT and EMBL banks revealed significant homology with the 'immunosuppressive domain' of the p15E envelope proteins of various oncogenic retroviruses. The possible role of such a homology is discussed.

1572982|t|Enzyme immunosorbent assay for Ebola virus antigens in tissues of infected primates.
1572982|a|A sandwich enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) using a mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies for antigen capture and polyclonal hyperimmune rabbit anti-Ebola virus serum for antigen detection was developed and evaluated on the tissues of monkeys naturally or experimentally infected with strains of Ebola viruses. When compared with virus isolation, the antigen detection EIA was both sensitive and specific: 44 of 45 (97.7%) liver homogenates and 38 of 41 (92.7%) spleen homogenates that were culture positive and tested by both techniques were positive for viral antigen, while 85 of 87 (97.7%) culture-negative liver homogenates and 66 of 66 culture-negative spleen homogenates were found to be antigen negative. The assay, initially developed to detect antigens of prototype African strains of Ebola virus, reliably detected related strains of Ebola virus found during two recent outbreaks of Ebola virus infection among imported, quarantined Macaca fascicularis monkeys in the United States. The assay allows economical and rapid testing of large numbers of tissue specimens. Antigen was found in homogenates of spleen and liver and in serum.

1621890|t|Outbreak of fatal illness among captive macaques in the Philippines caused by an Ebola-related filovirus.
1621890|a|Following the detection of an Ebola-like virus in cynomolgus macaques recently imported into the United States from The Philippines, studies were initiated to document transmission at export facilities located in the latter country. At one export facility, 52.8% of 161 monkeys that died over a 2.5-month period were shown to be infected with this virus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antigen in liver homogenates. A case fatality rate of 82.4% was documented for the infected monkeys. The initial anti-viral antibody prevalence among the captive macaques at this facility was 25.9% (indirect fluorescent antibody titer greater than or equal to 1:16). Followup documented infection of 24.4% of initially seronegative animals and 8.7% of initially seropositive monkeys. Being held in a gang cage versus a single cage was found to be a significant risk factor for subsequent virus infection, and the presence of IFA antibody was shown to predict protection. This study documents unequivocally for the first time the presence of an Ebola-related filovirus in Asia.

1794619|t|Virus zoonoses and their potential for contamination of cell cultures.
1794619|a|Silent virus infections of laboratory animals present a human health hazard, from direct exposure and from contamination of biological products for human use. Here we report two recent examples. In 1989, an outbreak of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections was recognized among workers at a cancer research center after an animal caretaker developed viral meningitis. Investigation revealed that multiple tumor cell lines at the facility were infected with LCMV, as were research animals injected with these cell lines. Of 82 workers tested, eight (10%) were found to have been infected. The infected workers were more likely than other animal handlers to report handling athymic (nude) mice (p less than .0.007). The number of nude mice used in this facilty had increased five-fold in the previous year, possibly explaining the timing of the outbreak. This is the first reported LCMV outbreak since 1975, and the first to implicate nude mice as a source of human LCMV infections. In November 1989 and January 1990, infections caused by two distinct Ebola-like filoviruses were discovered in non-human primates at quarantine facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Although 22 persons were considered to have high- or medium-risk exposures for Ebola infection, no Ebola-compatible illnesses occurred. One of the medium-risk persons had Ebola IgG antibodies confirmed by IFA and Western blot. Rigorous use of barrier precautions may have limited exposure and infection with these filoviruses. In February 1990, new groups of filovirus-infected monkeys were identified in Virginia and in Texas. Seroconversion occurred in four animal handlers, including one to very high titer, but again no illness was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2749110|t|Firsthand clinical observations of hemorrhagic manifestations in Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Zaire.
2749110|a|About 5 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak of Ebola virus fever in Yambuku, Zaire, several acute cases of the disease were observed. All of those affected had the following common signs and symptoms: sudden onset of high fever, with chills, headache, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, sore throat, expressionless face, and profound prostration. In some cases, on around the fifth day of the acute phase, the appearance of an exanthematous rash on the trunk announced the hemorrhagic manifestations: hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, bleeding ulcerations in the mouth and on the lips, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, and melena; epistaxis, ear bleeding, hematuria, and postpartum hemorrhages were also reported. All these hemorrhagic cases had a fatal outcome within about a week. The hemorrhagic manifestations were less severe in the cases that occurred by the end of the outbreak than in the first reported cases. Hemorrhagic manifestations were less frequent and less severe, or even absent, in the nonfatal cases (convalescents, serologically confirmed). No biologic investigation of the hemostatic impairment could be performed under the emergency conditions of this field study.

4045253|t|Pathophysiology of shock and hemorrhage in a fulminating viral infection (Ebola).
4045253|a|Eleven rhesus monkeys were monitored intensively during experimental infection with Ebola virus. Prominent neutrophilia with left shift and lymphopenia were the earliest abnormalities and were statistically significant by day 4 (P less than .02 and P less than .01, respectively). By day 4 falls in platelet counts were not statistically significant, whereas in vitro platelet aggregation was markedly depressed, progressing rapidly to complete failure by the time of maximum illness. Intraplatelet protein studies suggested this event was the result of in vivo activation and degranulation. Coagulation cascade defects were mainly in the intrinsic system and were surprisingly mild, with no evidence of selective consumption or production deficit of factor VII or VIII. When the possibility of indirectly mediated damage to endothelium possibly by a nonspecific immune response was examined, weight loss was less severe in drug-treated monkeys, and all had detectable plasma prostacyclin metabolites, but there was no improvement in survival.

4067737|t|Ultrastructural pathology of experimental Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus infection.
4067737|a|The organs of monkeys infected with Ebola haemorrhagic fever were examined by light and electron microscopy during the acute stage of the disease. The virus caused focal coagulative necrosis in the liver, spleen, kidney, lung and testis and widespread mild vascular damage. In the brain there was intense congestion, with erythrocyte 'sludging', but no inflammatory reaction. There was significant injury to the microvasculature in all organs. Virus replicated in endothelial cytoplasm causing focal necrosis, separation of tight junctions and detachment from basement membranes. These changes were associated with oedema and haemorrhage, but though contributing to the hypovolaemic shock were not sufficiently extensive to account for the severity of vascular collapse. Renal involvement was also clinically important. Some renal cellular injury was caused by direct virus invasion of glomerular endothelium and tubular epithelium, but much tubular damage was probably due to ischaemia resulting from thrombosis in the peritubular capillaries. The virus also replicated in lymphocytes and monocytes and in interstitial cells of the testis. Since particles were not found in seminiferous epithelium, the degeneration of spermatogonia and spermatocytes was probably secondary to ischaemia.

6138602|t|Haematological and biochemical monitoring of Ebola infection in rhesus monkeys: implications for patient management.
6138602|a|Patients with severe viral infections such as Lassa or Ebola may be denied adequate laboratory investigations because of justifiable fears among laboratory staff. This study in monkeys was designed to provide comprehensive haematological and biochemical monitoring in a contained environment during all stages of Ebola infection. Marked neutrophilia, depletion of lymphocytes, and early failure of platelet aggregation preceded a consumption coagulopathy with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and failure of prostacyclin production by vascular endothelium. Liver dysfunction was moderate but in conjunction with the dehydration and hypoalbuminaemia could be expected to precipitate renal failure and shock. It seems reasonable to anticipate successful patient support with a patient management isolator and treatment with platelet transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and possibly prostacyclin when haemostasis is defective during this otherwise self-limiting illness.

6352735|t|Development of an immunofluorescence focus assay for Ebola virus.
6352735|a|A 48-h indirect immunofluorescence focus assay for the quantitation of Ebola virus was developed, utilizing HeLa-229 cell monolayers. The dose dependency and the sensitivity of this assay as compared with conventional assays are reported. This indirect immunofluorescence focus assay can be used as a rapid, quantitative test for the detection of Ebola virus, an agent from Africa known to cause hemorrhagic fever.

6827145|t|Comparative analysis of the structural polypeptides of Ebola viruses from Sudan and Zaire.
6827145|a|Polypeptide structural analyses were performed by tryptic peptide mapping to assess the relationship between isolates of Ebola virus obtained in Sudan and Zaire. The results of these analyses indicate (1) that the Sudan and Zaire isolates are unique viral agents, (2) that multiple isolates within each group bear close resemblance to one another, (3) that suggestive evidence exists of conservation of homologous structure in the VP-2 (virion protein no. 2) nucleocapsid proteins of these viruses, and (4) that protein differences between the two Ebola virus subtypes appear to reside in the VP-1 and VP-3 virion polypeptides.

7029731|t|Marburg virus disease. The diagnosis and management of suspected cases.
7029731|a|Marburg virus disease is an African disease of unknown epidemiology. The infection is pantropic and highly contagious. Haemorrhage and other features cause serious morbidity and high mortality, and early diagnosis is essential. Viral haemorrhagic fever is diagnosed clinically and confirmed by coagulation studies. Electron microscopy and serology are necessary for the identification of the virus, as Lassa and Ebola viruses (among other organisms) give similar symptoms, and Ebola virus is morphologically indistinguishable from Marburg virus. Treatment is essentially supportive. Patients and contacts must be isolated and monitored, and extreme precautions must be taken by hospital and laboratory staff to prevent their own infection.

7431486|t|Virion nucleic acid of Ebola virus.
7431486|a|The virion nucleic acid of Ebola virus consists of a single-stranded RNA with a molecular weight of approximately 4.0 x 10(6). The virion RNA did not bind to oligodeoxythymidylic acid-cellulose under conditions known to bind RNAs rich in polyadenylic acid and was not infectious under conditions which yielded infectious RNA from Sindbis virus, suggesting that Ebola virus virion nucleic acid is a negative-stranded RNA.

7441205|t|Ebola virus: identification of virion structural proteins.
7441205|a|Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified Ebola virus revealed the presence of four major virion structural proteins which we have designated VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) proteins were used as mol. wt. markers, and the virion proteins were found to have mol. wt. of 125000 (VP1), 104000 (VP2), 40000 (VP3) and 26000 (VP4). VP1 was labelled with glucosamine and is probably a glycoprotein. The density of the Ebola virion was approx. 1.14g/ml in potassium tartrate. Virus nucleocapsids with a density of 1.32g/ml in caesium chloride were released when virions were treated with detergents. Proteins VP2 and VP3 were consistently associated with released nucleocapsids and are probably the major structural nucleocapsid proteins analogous to the N protein of VSV. Protein VP4 was reduced or absent in released nucleocapsids and is probably analogous to the membrane (M) protein of VSV and similar viruses. The glycoprotein (VP1) is larger than the glycoprotein of any known negative-strand RNA virus and is not labelled well with 35S-methionine. VP1 is solubilized by detergent treatment, suggesting that it is a component of the virion spikes and analogous to the G protein of VSV. Our results, in conjunction with analysis of Ebola virion RNA (Regnery et al. 1980), strongly suggest that the virus is a negative-strand RNA virus and, along with marburg virus, may constitute a new taxon within this group.

7453587|t|[A new viral infectious disease: Ebola haemorrhagic fever (author's transl)].
7453587|a|All references about a new viral infection, which was seen in Sudan and Zaire at 1976 called "Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever" with high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and great systemic haemorrhagic manifestations were reviewed. We discussed the history, etiology, epidemiology, source of infections, mode of transmission, period of communicability, clinical and laboratory findings and control measures of the disease. Some comments were made about what could be done, if a new disease of unknown etiology is seen in any part of our country.

7547435|t|Lethal experimental infections of rhesus monkeys by aerosolized Ebola virus.
7547435|a|The potential of aerogenic infection by Ebola virus was established by using a head-only exposure aerosol system. Virus-containing droplets of 0.8-1.2 microns were generated and administered into the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys via inhalation. Inhalation of viral doses as low as 400 plaque-forming units of virus caused a rapidly fatal disease in 4-5 days. The illness was clinically identical to that reported for parenteral virus inoculation, except for the occurrence of subcutaneous and venipuncture site bleeding and serosanguineous nasal discharge. Immunocytochemistry revealed cell-associated Ebola virus antigens present in airway epithelium, alveolar pneumocytes, and macrophages in the lung and pulmonary lymph nodes; extracellular antigen was present on mucosal surfaces of the nose, oropharynx and airways. Aggregates of characteristic filamentous virus were present within type I pneumocytes, macrophages, and air spaces of the lung by electron microscopy. Demonstration of fatal aerosol transmission of this virus in monkeys reinforces the importance of taking appropriate precautions to prevent its potential aerosol transmission to humans.

7676671|t|[Experimental Ebola fever in Macaca mulatta].
7676671|a|Aerogenic infection of M. rhesus with Ebola virus causes in them a disease similar in the principal clinical and virological parameters a grave form of Ebola fever in humans, as it is described in literature. Rapid development of symptoms of total intoxication in the presence of fever, hemorrhagic diathesis, and high viremia are indicative of the infection severity in monkeys.

7716910|t|[Composition and immunochemical properties of goat immunoglobulins against the Ebola virus].
7716910|a|Serum samples containing Ebola Virus neutralizing antibodies were prepared by prolonged immunization of goats with 10% liver homogenate from guinea pigs infected with Ebola virus. Differences in IgG fractions of normal and hyperimmune caprine blood sera were detected. Analytical chromatography on Polysil SA and immunodiffusion showed the presence of three IgG-containing fractions in hyperimmune sera. Immunochemical properties of these fractions were studied by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay and neutralization test. Antibodies to viral antigens were referred to IgG2 and IgG1a, and virus neutralizing properties were found mainly in IgG2 antibodies. Immunoglobulins were isolated from hyperimmune serum by alcohol sedimentation. The principal IgG fraction was found to contain much lower levels of antibodies to guinea pig liver antigens than intact serum, but at the same time it was characterized by a higher neutralization index.

7762236|t|[The effect of some physical and chemical factors on inactivation of the Ebola virus].
7762236|a|Ebola virus was found to survive multiple freezing and thawing, stable at storage, and poorly inactivated by UV irradiation. At the same time, common disinfectants reliably inactivate this virus.

8017061|t|[The evaluation in hamadryas baboons of the possibility for the specific prevention of Ebola fever].
8017061|a|The protective role of virus-neutralizing antibody was demonstrated in Ebola virus-infected animals (Papio hamadryas) used in experiments on the development of passive humoral immunity by using specific immunoglobulin. Two immunizations of the monkeys with purified concentrated Ebola virus antigen with complete Freund adjuvant was shown to confirm intensive immunity to subsequent challenge protecting 80% of the immunized animals. It is concluded that effective preparations may be developed for specific prophylaxis of Ebola fever.

8236944|t|[The morphological changes in Ebola infection in guinea pigs].
8236944|a|Ebola virus reproduction and morphological lesions were investigated in infected guinea pigs by electron microscopy. The liver was found to be the main target organ, whereas in other internal organs the pathological changes were insignificant. Ebola virus reproduction was demonstrated only in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

8236945|t|[The ultrastructural changes in guinea pig organs during the serial passage of the Ebola virus].
8236945|a|Morphological study of internal organs of guinea pigs inoculated with Ebola virus at 2-8 passages was carried out. In the course of these passages the number of infected cells and virus particles in the organs was shown to increase, and the destructive changes in organs became more pronounced. In the 1st-3rd passages Ebola virus replication was observed in macrophagal cells only but beginning from the 4th passage of virus reproduction was found also in hepatocytes, spongiocytes, and fibroblasts.

8237108|t|Sequence analysis of the Ebola virus genome: organization, genetic elements, and comparison with the genome of Marburg virus.
8237108|a|Sequence analysis of the second through the sixth genes of the Ebola virus (EBO) genome indicates that it is organized similarly to rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses and is virtually the same as Marburg virus (MBG). In vitro translation experiments and predicted amino acid sequence comparisons showed that the order of the EBO genes is: 3'-NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L. The transcriptional start and stop (polyadenylation) signals are conserved and all contain the sequence 3'-UAAUU. Three base intergenic sequences are present between the NP and VP35 genes (3'-GAU) and VP40 and GP genes (3'-AGC), and a large intergenic sequence of 142 bases separates the VP30 and VP24 genes. Novel gene overlaps were found between the VP35 and VP40, the GP and VP30, and the VP24 and L genes. Overlaps are 20 or 18 bases in length and are limited to the conserved sequences determined for the transcriptional signals. Stem-and-loop structures were identified in the putative (+) leader RNA and at the 5' end of each mRNA. Hybridization studies showed that a small second mRNA is transcribed from the glycoprotein gene, and is produced by termination of transcription at an atypical polyadenylation signal located in the middle of the coding region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a hydrophobic anchor sequence, and 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences showed that the structural proteins of EBO and MBG contain large regions of homology despite the absence of serologic cross-reactivity.

8257297|t|Ebola protein analyses for the determination of genetic organization.
8257297|a|Amino-acid sequencing of the purified major nucleoprotein (NP), VP35 and VP40 from purified Ebola virus proved that they are the protein products of the first three genes, and that the open reading frame (ORF) of the NP begins at nucleotide 470. Because of the many unusual features of the ORFs of Ebola virus, we thought that our conclusions should be substantiated. Comparisons of in vitro-translation products to purified viral proteins were used to demonstrate conclusively that the NP, VP35 and VP40 were the protein products of genes one, two, and three, respectively. Studies using antibodies to synthetic peptides matching the N- and C-termini of the deduced sequences from these genes confirmed these conclusions and that the ORF for the NP begins at nucleotide 470. Subsequent studies confirmed that VP30 is encoded by the fifth gene.

8482365|t|The VP35 and VP40 proteins of filoviruses. Homology between Marburg and Ebola viruses.
8482365|a|The fragments of genomic RNA sequences of Marburg (MBG) and Ebola (EBO) viruses are reported. These fragments were found to encode the VP35 and VP40 proteins. The canonic sequences were revealed before and after each open reading frame. It is suggested that these sequences are mRNA extremities and at the same time the regulatory elements for mRNA transcription. Homology between the MBG and EBO proteins was discovered.

8534175|t|[The efficacy of the emergency prophylactic and therapeutic actions of immunomodulators in experimental filovirus infections].
8534175|a|The study of the preventive and therapeutic action of some immunomodulators (ridostin, reaferon and polyribonate) used alone and in combinations was conducted on laboratory animals infected aerogenically by Marburg or Ebola virus. It was found that special preventive intranasal and intramuscular administration of ridostin provided protection of the animals infected by Marburg virus (p = 0.1) and an increase in their mean lifespan by 2.4 days (p = 0.15). In the Ebola infection combined administration of ridostin and reaferon caused an essential increase in the mean lifespan of the animals by 2.9 days (p = 0.04). None of the tested drugs had any significant positive effect when used in various combinations according to the treatment schemes in Marburg and Ebola infections in guinea pigs.

8551825|t|Transmission of Ebola virus (Zaire strain) to uninfected control monkeys in a biocontainment laboratory.
8551825|a|Secondary transmission of Ebola virus infection in humans is known to be caused by direct contact with infected patients or body fluids. We report transmission of Ebola virus (Zaire strain) to two of three control rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that did not have direct contact with experimentally inoculated monkeys held in the same room. The two control monkeys died from Ebola virus infections at 10 and 11 days after the last experimentally inoculated monkey had died. The most likely route of infection of the control monkeys was aerosol, oral or conjunctival exposure to virus-laden droplets secreted or excreted from the experimentally inoculated monkeys. These observations suggest approaches to the study of routes of transmission to and among humans.

8553543|t|GP mRNA of Ebola virus is edited by the Ebola virus polymerase and by T7 and vaccinia virus polymerases.
8553543|a|The glycoprotein gene of Ebola virus contains a translational stop codon in the middle, thus preventing synthesis of full-length glycoprotein. Twenty percent of the mRNA isolated from Ebola virus-infected cells was shown to be edited, containing one additional nontemplate A in a stretch of seven consecutive A residues. Only the edited mRNA species encoded full-length glycoprotein, whereas the exact copies of the viral template coded for a smaller secreted glycoprotein. Expression of the glycoprotein by an in vitro transcription/translation system, by the vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase system, and by recombinant vaccinia virus revealed that full-length glycoprotein was synthesized not only when the edited glycoprotein gene (8A's) was used as a template for T7 and vaccinia virus polymerases, but also when the nonedited (genomic) glycoprotein gene was used. Analysis of mRNA produced by T7 and vaccinia virus polymerase from the 7A's construct revealed that 1-5% contained alterations at the same site that was also edited by the Ebola virus polymerase. Our data indicate that the editing site in the Ebola virus glycoprotein gene is recognized not only by Ebola virus polymerase but also by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases of different origin.

8622982|t|The virion glycoproteins of Ebola viruses are encoded in two reading frames and are expressed through transcriptional editing.
8622982|a|In late 1994 and early 1995, Ebola (EBO) virus dramatically reemerged in Africa, causing human disease in the Ivory Coast and Zaire. Analysis of the entire glycoprotein genes of these viruses and those of other EBO virus subtypes has shown that the virion glycoprotein (130 kDa) is encoded in two reading frames, which are linked by transcriptional editing. This editing results in the addition of an extra nontemplated adenosine within a run of seven adenosines near the middle of the coding region. The primary gene product is a smaller (50-70 kDa), nonstructural, secreted glycoprotein, which is produced in large amounts and has an unknown function. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that EBO virus subtypes are genetically diverse and that the recent Ivory Coast isolate represents a new (fourth) subtype of EBO virus. In contrast, the EBO virus isolate from the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, is virtually identical to the virus that caused a similar epidemic in Yambuku, Zaire, almost 20 years earlier. This genetic stability may indicate that EBO viruses have coevolved with their natural reservoirs and do not change appreciably in the wild.

8625857|t|Threat of Marburg and Ebola viral haemorrhagic fevers in Africa.
8625857|a|Marburg and Ebola viruses are members of the filovirus family that can be regarded as recently emerged. These viruses have caused sporadic outbreaks of fatal haemorrhagic disease in Africa, Europe and recently in the USA. The case fatality rates rank among the highest ranging from 33-80%. The mode of transmission of these viruses are clearly through close contact with blood and body fluids. Disease outbreaks have been amplified in hospital situations with poor blood precautions. In villages disease has been amplified through contamination with blood and fluids during nursing the sick and burial rituals. The source of the viruses has eluded discovery and new theories regarding the nature of these viruses are being entertained. The threat of new outbreaks in Africa is real since serological evidence of the presence of the virus has been documented in Kenya, Sudan, Zaire, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Cote-d'Ivoire and Gabon.

8678836|t|Ebola virus infection in guinea pigs: presumable role of granulomatous inflammation in pathogenesis.
8678836|a|An approach combining virology with light and electron microscopy was used to study the organs of guinea pigs during nine serial passages of Ebola virus, strain Zaire. It was observed that the wild type of Ebola virus causes severe granulomatous inflammation in the liver and reproduces in the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Based on morphological characterization, two types of virus-cell interactions were demonstrated. The obtained data evidenced for heterogeneity of the population of wild type of Ebola virus. The virus accumulated in the liver of the infected animals, and the lesions became more pronounced with passage. Degenerative changes appeared, and their severity was increased with passage in the other organs as well. The set of target cells diversified and, as a result, not only the MPS cells, but also hepatocytes, spongiocytes, endotheliocytes and fibroblasts became involved in the reproduction of Ebola virus. The possible role of granulomatous inflammation in the development of the adaptive mechanism of Ebola virus to guinea pigs is discussed.

8686261|t|[Attempts to develop a vaccine against Ebola fever].
8686261|a|Data on the immunopathogenesis of Ebola fever in laboratory animals are presented and the efficacy of some methods of vaccine prophylaxis discussed. Antiviral immunity induced in guinea pigs by injection of inactivated viral agents did not protect them from infection, whereas injections of a nonlethal strain of the virus in ascending doses led to the formation of immunity preventing the development of disease upon inoculation with a lethal strain in high doses. The role of some viral peptides in the development of immune response is shown and variants of recombinant constructions for the prevention of Ebola fever are offered.

8800793|t|Experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with Ebola-Reston filoviruses from the 1989-1990 U.S. epizootic.
8800793|a|This study describes the pathogenesis of the Ebola-Reston (EBO-R) subtype of Ebola virus for experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys. The disease course of EBO-R in macaques was very similar to human disease and to experimental diseases in macaques following EBO-Zaire and EBO-Sudan infections. Cynomolgus monkeys infected with EBO-R in this experiment developed anorexia, occasional nasal discharge, and splenomegaly, petechial facial hemorrhages and severe subcutaneous hemorrhages in venipuncture sites, similar to human Ebola fever. Five of the six EBO-R infected monkeys died, 8 to 14 days after inoculation. One survived and developed high titered neutralizing antibodies specific for EBO-R. The five acutely ill monkeys shed infectious virus in various bodily secretions. Further, abundant virus was visualized in alveolar interstitial cells and free in the alveoli suggesting the potential for generating infectious aerosols. Thus, taking precautions against aerosol exposures to filovirus infected primates, including humans, seems prudent. This experiment demonstrated that EBO-R was lethal for macaques and was capable of initiating and sustaining the monkey epizootic. Further investigation of this animal model should facilitate development of effective immunization, treatment, and control strategies for Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

8800795|t|Passive immunization of Ebola virus-infected cynomolgus monkeys with immunoglobulin from hyperimmune horses.
8800795|a|A commercially available immunoglobulin G (IgG) from horses, hyperimmunized to Ebola virus, was evaluated for its ability to protect cynomolgus monkeys against disease following i.m. inoculation with 1 000 PFU Ebola virus (Zaire '95 strain). Six monkeys were treated immediately after infection by i.m. infection of 6.0 ml IgG; these animals developed passive ELISA titers of 1:160 to 1:320 to Ebola, two days afer inoculation. However, the beneficial effects of IgG treatment were limited to a delay in onset of viremia and clinical signs, in comparison with untreated controls. The six IgG recipients had no detectable viremia day 5, in contrast with three virus infected controls whose viremias exceeded 7.0 log10 PFU/ml that day. The controls died on days 6, 6, and 7, while two IgG recipients died day 7 and the remaining 4 died day 8, all with high viremias. These results document that passively acquired antibody can have a beneficial effect in reducing the viral burden in Ebola-infected primates; however, effective treatment of human patients may require antibodies with higher specific activities and more favorable pharmacokinetic properties than the presently available equine IgG.

8800808|t|Emerging and reemerging of filoviruses.
8800808|a|Filoviruses are causative agents of a hemorrhagic fever in man with mortalities ranging from 22 to 88%. They are enveloped, nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses and are separated into two types, Marburg and Ebola, which can be serologically, biochemically and genetically distinguished. In general, there is little genetic variability among viruses belonging to the Marburg type. The Ebola type, however, is subdivided into at least three distinct subtypes. Marburg virus was first isolated during an outbreak in Europe in 1967. Ebola virus emerged in 1976 as the causative agent of two simultaneous outbreaks in southern Sudan and northern Zaire. The reemergence of Ebola, subtype Zaire, in Kikwit 1995 caused a worldwide sensation, since it struck after a sensibilization on the danger of Ebola virus disease. Person-to-person transmission by intimate contact is the main route of infection, but transmission by droplets and small aerosols among infected individuals is discussed. The natural reservoir for filoviruses remains a mystery. Filoviruses are prime examples for emerging pathogens. Factors that may be involved in emergence are international commerce and travel, limited experience in diagnosis and case management, import of nonhuman primates, and the potential of filoviruses for rapid evolution.

8837880|t|Differentiation of filoviruses by electron microscopy.
8837880|a|Cultured monolayers of MA-104, Vero 76, SW-13, and DBS-FRhL-2 cells were infected with Marburg (MBG), Ebola-Sudan (EBO-S), Ebola-Zaire (EBO-Z), and Ebola-Reston (EBO-R) viruses (Filoviridae, Filovirus) and examined by electron microscopy to provide ultrastructural details of morphology and morphogenesis of these potential human pathogens. Replication of each filovirus was seen in all cell systems employed. Filoviral particles appeared to enter host cells by endocytosis. Filoviruses showed a similar progression of morphogenic events, from the appearance of nascent intracytoplasmic viral inclusions to formation of mature virions budded through plasma membranes, regardless of serotype or host cell. However, ultrastructural differences were demonstrated between MBG and other filoviruses. MBG virions recovered from culture fluids were uniformly shorter in mean unit length than EBO-S, EBO-Z, or EBO-R particles. Examination of filovirus-infected cells revealed that intermediate MBG inclusions were morphologically distinct from EBO-S, EBO-Z, and EBO-R inclusions. No structural difference of viral inclusion material was observed among EBO-S, EBO-Z, and EBO-R. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the filoviral matrix protein (VP40) and nucleoprotein (NP) accumulated in EBO-Z inclusions, and were closely associated during viral morphogenesis. These details facilitate the efficient and definitive diagnosis of filoviral infections by electron microscopy.

8935292|t|Ebola virus infection: an overview.
8935292|a|The current outbreak of the Ebola virus infection in Africa has yet again proven that highly dangerous diseases that are transmitted via the blood-borne route may be endemic in some parts of the world and may emerge as sporadic outbreaks causing worldwide concern. Health care professionals are at the forefront of combatting these diseases and treating infected individuals. Though dental professionals are unlikely to be directly involved in the management of such acute infections, with very high mortality rates, they may encounter patients seeking dental treatment who are either from, or who have recently toured the endemic disease areas. This overview, therefore, is a thumb nail sketch of the Ebola virus infection and its implications for dentistry.

8938109|t|A novel hypothesis to explain the hemorrhagic and connective tissue manifestations of Ebola virus infection.
8938109|a|The hemorrhagic and connective tissue complications of infection with Ebola virus are poorly understood. While searching for homologies and motifs of the aortic aneurysm-associated autoantigenic protein 40 kDa (AAAP-40), we have noted some short sequences (possibly shared epitopes) that occur in the envelope glycoprotein (40 kDa) of the Ebola virus. As a first step toward determining whether molecular mimicry of human matrix proteins by the Ebola virus protein might explain some of the severe connective tissue manifestations of infection, we have tested whether immunoglobulin (IgG) purified from the sera of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are immunoreactive with the 40-kDa protein of the Ebola virus. Immunoblots of soluble Ebola proteins (strain Mayinga/Zaire) were probed with IgG's purified from the sera of eight patients with AAA and two healthy young control volunteers. The proteins were also probed with IgG extracted from the walls of two surgical aneurysm specimens. Serum IgG from eight consecutively studied AAA patients was immunoreactive with an Ebola virus protein of 40 kDa, consistent with the envelope glycoprotein. IgG's extracted from the walls of two AAAs were also reactive. The control sera were not reactive. In addition to the Ebola sequences in AAAP-40, an Ebola sequence also occurs in the microfibril-associated glycoprotein-4 (MAGP-4), which is distributed ubiquitously throughout connective tissue with elastin. We hypothesize that the catastrophic hemorrhagic and connective tissue complications of Ebola virus infection may be the result of these shared epitopes.

8969248|t|Experimental inoculation of plants and animals with Ebola virus.
8969248|a|Thirty-three varieties of 24 species of plants and 19 species of vertebrates and invertebrates were experimentally inoculated with Ebola Zaire virus. Fruit and insectivorous bats supported replication and circulation of high titers of virus without necessarily becoming ill; deaths occurred only among bats that had not adapted to the diet fed in the laboratory.

9035363|t|Computer simulations of proteolysis of Marburg and Ebola-Zaire filovirus coded proteins to generate nonapeptides with motifs of known HLA class I haplotypes and detection of antigenic domains in the viral glycoproteins.
9035363|a|The primary amino acid sequences of the proteins coded by Marburg and Ebola-Zaire filoviruses were studied by computer programs to search for putative proteolytic cleavages which yield nonapeptides with motifs of binding to known HLA class I haplotypes. The computer analyses predicted that numerous nonapeptides with motifs to bind HLA class I A68 and A2 haplotypes were detected. A few nonapeptides with motifs HLA class I A24, B8, B27 and B35 were predicted in Marburg virus proteins. A similar finding is reported for Ebola-Zaire viral proteins (the viral polymerase was not studied). The search for antigenic domains that may induce the humoral immune response in the viral glycoproteins was based on computer analyses of the physical properties and antigenicity predictions of amino acids in certain domains of the primary amino acid sequences. Twelve putative antigenic domains were detected in Marburg virus glycoprotein and 11 putative antigenic domains in Ebola-Zaire virus glycoprotein. Despite the marked differences in the primary amino acid sequences in the putative antigenic domains of the two viral glycoproteins, 8 antigenic domains were found to have similar locations in the viral glycoproteins of the two viruses. Each pair of antigenic domains resemble each other in the physical properties of the amino acids that are different. These computer analyses may provide an approach to developing synthetic peptides capable of induction of both the cellular and humoral responses to protect against infection with Marburg or Ebola viruses.

9103042|t|[Developing principles for emergency prevention and treatment of Ebola fever].
9103042|a|The authors validate the efficiency of pathogenetic approach to the development of urgent measures for the prevention and therapy of Ebola fever. The virus circulating in the body is to be blocked as soon as possible and the impaired functions and systems repaired. Therapy of Ebola fever should be based on the earliest possible and sufficiently prolonged administration of specific immunoglobulins in combination with pathogenetic drugs.

9182399|t|[Study of the phagocytic ability of blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes from rabbits and guinea pigs upon administering Ebola virus].
9182399|a|Study of the phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) of rabbits resistant to Ebola virus and guinea pigs susceptible to it, repeatedly challenged with live or inactivated Ebola virus in accordance with the immunization protocols, showed a much higher phagocytic activity in animals resistant to the virus than in those susceptible to it. Such behavior of PMNL in guinea pigs may be explained by the absence of the necessary cytokine background activating the neutrophils.

9182402|t|[False-positive reactions in laboratory diagnosis of Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola viral hemorrhagic fevers and AIDS].
9182402|a|Sera of normal subjects and AIDS patients living in Minsk and Odessa were tested for antibodies to hazardous viral infections Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola. Four to 16% of examinees were seropositive to Ebola virus, 0.8 to 2.3% to Lassa, and up to 0.8% to Marburg virus. Common B-epitopes were found in viruses belonging to different families: Lassa, Ebola, and HIV. Antibodies specific to these viruses antigens were found in the reference sera to influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus. Sera of convalescents after malaria and of AIDS patients contained antibodies to Lassa virus.

9182409|t|[Effect of inactivated Ebola virus on colony forming activity of human hematopoietic stem cells].
9182409|a|The effect of Ebola virus antigen on the growth of hemopoietic precursors was studied. Incubation of mononuclear cells with the viral antigen led to a dose-dependent decrease of erythroid colony formation but did not alter the growth of the granulocyto-macrophagal precursors. Hence, Ebola virus antigen is capable of directly affecting the hemopoietic activity of precursors in man by inhibiting the growth of erythroid colonies.

9278604|t|Emerging and reemerging infections. Progress and challenges in the subspecialty of infectious disease pathology.
9278604|a|Emerging and reemerging infections are attracting greater attention from the public health and medical communities. Pathologists and other physicians are increasingly aware of the importance of the subspecialty of infectious disease pathology as a tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research of emerging infections. In this communication, we describe the role that infectious disease pathologists have played during the last 2 years in broadening our understanding of selected emerging infections, including such examples as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, leptospirosis, microsporidiosis, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and cyclosporiasis. The significance of providing pathology services, especially the autopsy, to patients with potentially hazardous communicable diseases is discussed with the supposition that it is unethical to exclude or withhold health care from a patient based on his or her underlying disease or on risk factors for acquiring a disease. The increasing occurrence of infectious diseases imported into the United States and other nations, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 group O, dengue fever, tuberculosis, malaria, diphtheria and cholera in immigrants and travelers, and Ebola virus in nonhuman primates, emphasizes the necessity for pathologists of having competence with infectious disease pathology. It is critical that new generations of pathologists not only be trained in the subspecialty of infectious disease pathology, but that they also be willing participants in the diagnosis and investigation of infectious diseases. The lack of training programs for infectious disease pathologists, as well as the deficiency in infectious disease pathology support for ongoing and future epidemiologic investigations and research, has led to the broadening of pathology services and initiation of a dedicated section of Infectious Disease Pathology at one of the nation's premier public health institutions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga. Together with preexisting groups of medical and veterinary infectious disease pathologists at universities, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and the National Institutes of Health, this new program will significantly strengthen the capability of the United States to respond to future challenges of emerging and reemerging infections, both in this country and abroad.

9297340|t|[Immunobiological properties of vp24 protein of Ebola virus expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus].
9297340|a|Immunological and biochemical parameters were studied in guinea pigs immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus containing full-sized gene of Ebola virus vp24 protein and then infected with virulent strain of Ebola virus. The majority of the studied parameters changed similarly in guinea pigs immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus and control guinea pigs inoculated with vaccinia virus both before and after challenge with Ebola virus. However, in animals immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus producing vp24 some biochemical parameters, the mean life span after challenge with Ebola virus, the level of antibodies to the virus, and the phagocytic activity of neutrophils indicated the development of immunological processes other than in controls, namely, the development of immune response to vp24. Although these processes did not eventually lead to the survival of animals, they prolonged the mean life span and resulted in the production of anti-Ebola antibodies, though the level thereof was low. These data demonstrate that recombinant vaccines against Ebola fever are a promising trend of research.

9297348|t|[Changes in certain indicators of hemostasis in rabbits upon administration of Ebola virus preparations].
9297348|a|Changes in some parameters of hemostasis in rabbits insusceptible to Ebola virus (EV) in various periods after reinoculations with live and inactivated virus are described. Challenge with both control protein and live and inactivated EV leads to imbalance in the hemostasis system, which is compensated for in the course of follow-up and does not result in clinically manifest disorders of blood clotting. However, the mechanisms of development of the hemostasis imbalance caused by the control protein and virus preparations were different. In the former case no fibrinogen degradation products were detected in the blood serum, whereas in the latter they appeared in the serum after each reinoculation of the virus. This indicates a peculiar effect of EV on hemostasis.

9304298|t|[Change in biochemical and hemostatic indicators in guinea pigs upon administering Ebola virus preparations].
9304298|a|The biochemical and hemostatic parameters were compared in guinea pigs after inoculation of Ebola virus strains lethal and nonlethal for them and of inactivated antigen of this virus. The time course of the main hemostatic and biochemical parameters in animals challenged with the lethal strain of Ebola virus differed much from that in other groups. This permits us to hypothesize that modification of the virus in the course of adaptation to the host results in the appearance of properties boosting the enzymatic processes and, hence, in depletion and failure of antioxidant and hemostatic defence, which aggravates the pathological process.

9405687|t|A system for functional analysis of Ebola virus glycoprotein.
9405687|a|Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, resulting in mortality rates of up to 90%. Studies of this virus have been hampered by its extraordinary pathogenicity, which requires biosafety level 4 containment. To circumvent this problem, we developed a novel complementation system for functional analysis of Ebola virus glycoproteins. It relies on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that contains the green fluorescent protein gene instead of the receptor-binding G protein gene (VSVDeltaG*). Herein we show that Ebola Reston virus glycoprotein (ResGP) is efficiently incorporated into VSV particles. This recombinant VSV with integrated ResGP (VSVDeltaG*-ResGP) infected primate cells more efficiently than any of the other mammalian or avian cells examined, in a manner consistent with the host range tropism of Ebola virus, whereas VSVDeltaG* complemented with VSV G protein (VSVDeltaG*-G) efficiently infected the majority of the cells tested. We also tested the utility of this system for investigating the cellular receptors for Ebola virus. Chemical modification of cells to alter their surface proteins markedly reduced their susceptibility to VSVDeltaG*-ResGP but not to VSVDeltaG*-G. These findings suggest that cell surface glycoproteins with N-linked oligosaccharide chains contribute to the entry of Ebola viruses, presumably acting as a specific receptor and/or cofactor for virus entry. Thus, our VSV system should be useful for investigating the functions of glycoproteins from highly pathogenic viruses or those incapable of being cultured in vitro.

9424849|t|[Study of the treatment-prophylactic effect of immunomodulators in experimental infections, caused by Marburg, Ebola, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses].
9424849|a|Therapeutic and prophylactic effects of immunomodifiers ridostin, reaferon, and polyribonate used alone and in various combinations were assessed in experiments on guinea pigs infected with Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) (strain Trinidad), Marburg (strain Popp), and Ebola (M/C-8 variant of Zaire strain) viruses at doses 5 to 20 respiratory LD50 through the respiratory airways. Urgent prophylactic simultaneous intramuscular and intranasal administration of ridostin protected the animals infected with Marburg virus (p = 0.1) and prolonged their life span by 2.4 days (p = 0.15). In Ebola infection a combination of ridostin and reaferon appreciably prolonged the mean life span: by 2.9 days (p = 0.04). In VEE ridostin alone or in combination with reaferone appreciably increased the share of survivors; ridostin with reaferon and polyribonate notably prolonged the mean life span of infected animals. None of these drugs or combinations produced an appreciable therapeutic effect in any of the studied infections.

9427604|t|Immunization for Ebola virus infection.
9427604|a|Infection by Ebola virus causes rapidly progressive, often fatal, symptoms of fever, hemorrhage and hypotension. Previous attempts to elicit protective immunity for this disease have not met with success. We report here that protection against the lethal effects of Ebola virus can be achieved in an animal model by immunizing with plasmids encoding viral proteins. We analyzed immune responses to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the secreted or transmembrane forms of the glycoprotein (sGP or GP) and their ability to protect against infection in a guinea pig infection model analogous to the human disease. Protection was achieved and correlated with antibody titer and antigen-specific T-cell responses to sGP or GP. Immunity to Ebola virus can therefore be developed through genetic vaccination and may facilitate efforts to limit the spread of this disease.

9448698|t|Variation in the glycoprotein and VP35 genes of Marburg virus strains.
9448698|a|Marburg virus, the prototype of the family Filoviridae, differs genetically, serologically, and morphologically from Ebola viruses. To better define the genetic variation within the species, VP35 and glycoprotein (GP) genes of representative human isolates from four known episodes of Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever were analyzed. The percentage nucleotide differences in the GP gene coding regions of Marburg viruses (0.1-21%) was nearly equal to the percentage amino acid changes (0-23%), while the percentage nucleotide differences in VP35 coding regions (0.3-20.9%) were higher than the percentage amino acid changes (0.9-6.1%), indicating a greater number of nonsynonymous changes occurring in the GP gene. The higher variation in the GP gene and the corresponding protein, especially those changes in the variable middle region of the GP, suggests that the variability may be the result of responses to natural host pressures. Analysis of the GP gene open reading frame shows a nonrandom distribution of nonsynonymous mutations that may indicate positive Darwinian selection is operating within the variable region. A heptad repeat region and an adjoining predicted fusion peptide are found in the C-terminal third of Marburg virus GPs, as has been previously shown for Ebola virus, and are similar to those found in transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses. Comparative analyses showed that there are two lineages within the Marburg virus species of filoviruses. The most recent isolate from Kenya (1987) represents a separate genetic lineage within the Marburg virus species (21-23% amino acid difference). However, this lineage likely does not represent a separate Marburg subtype, as the extent of divergence is less than that separating Ebola virus subtypes.

9461435|t|Distinct cellular interactions of secreted and transmembrane Ebola virus glycoproteins.
9461435|a|The mechanisms by which Ebola virus evades detection and infects cells to cause hemorrhagic fever have not been defined, though its glycoprotein, synthesized in either a secreted or transmembrane form, is likely involved. Here the secreted glycoprotein was found to interact with neutrophils through CD16b, the neutrophil-specific form of the Fc gamma receptor III, whereas the transmembrane glycoprotein was found to interact with endothelial cells but not neutrophils. A murine retroviral vector pseudotyped with the transmembrane glycoprotein preferentially infected endothelial cells. Thus, the secreted glycoprotein inhibits early neutrophil activation, which likely affects the host response to infection, whereas binding of the transmembrane glycoprotein to endothelial cells may contribute to the hemorrhagic symptoms of this disease.

9499027|t|Phosphatidylinositol-dependent membrane fusion induced by a putative fusogenic sequence of Ebola virus.
9499027|a|The membrane-interacting abilities of three sequences representing the putative fusogenic subdomain of the Ebola virus transmembrane protein have been investigated. In the presence of calcium, the sequence EBO(GE) (GAAIGLAWIPYFGPAAE) efficiently fused unilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol (molar ratio, 2:1:1:0.5), a mixture that roughly resembles the lipid composition of the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Analysis of the lipid dependence of the process demonstrated that the fusion activity of EBO(GE) was promoted by phosphatidylinositol but not by other acidic phospholipids. In comparison, EBO(EA) (EGAAIGLAWIPYFGPAA) and EBO(EE) (EGAAIGLAWIPYFGPAAE) sequences, which are similar to EBO(GE) except that they bear the negatively charged glutamate residue at the N terminus and at both the N and C termini, respectively, induced fusion to a lesser extent. As revealed by binding experiments, the glutamate residue at the N terminus severely impaired peptide-vesicle interaction. In addition, the fusion-competent EBO(GE) sequence did not associate significantly with vesicles lacking phosphatidylinositol. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching by vesicles containing brominated phospholipids indicated that the EBO(GE) peptide penetrated to the acyl chain level only when the membranes contained phosphatidylinositol. We conclude that binding and further penetration of the Ebola virus putative fusion peptide into membranes might be governed by the nature of the N-terminal residue and by the presence of phosphatidylinositol in the target membrane. Moreover, since insertion of such a peptide leads to membrane destabilization and fusion, the present data would be compatible with the involvement of this sequence in Ebola virus fusion.

9525641|t|Characterization of Ebola virus entry by using pseudotyped viruses: identification of receptor-deficient cell lines.
9525641|a|Studies analyzing Ebola virus replication have been severely hampered by the extreme pathogenicity of this virus. To permit analysis of the host range and function of the Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ebo-GP), we have developed a system for pseudotyping these glycoproteins into murine leukemia virus (MLV). This pseudotyped virus, MLV(Ebola), can be readily concentrated to titers which exceed 5 x 10(6) infectious units/ml and is effectively neutralized by antibodies specific for Ebo-GP. Analysis of MLV(Ebola) infection revealed that the host range conferred by Ebo-GP is very broad, extending to cells of a variety of species. Notably, all lymphoid cell lines tested were completely resistant to infection; we speculate that this is due to the absence of a cellular receptor for Ebo-GP on B and T cells. The generation of high-titer MLV(Ebola) pseudotypes will be useful for the analysis of immune responses to Ebola virus infection, development of neutralizing antibodies, analysis of glycoprotein function, and isolation of the cellular receptor(s) for the Ebola virus.

9576958|t|Processing of the Ebola virus glycoprotein by the proprotein convertase furin.
9576958|a|In the present study, we have investigated processing and maturation of the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus. When GP expressed from vaccinia virus vectors was analyzed by pulse-chase experiments, the mature form and two different precursors were identified. First, the endoplasmic reticulum form preGPer, full-length GP with oligomannosidic N-glycans, was detected. preGPer (110 kDa) was replaced by the Golgi-specific form preGP (160 kDa), full-length GP containing mature carbohydrates. preGP was finally converted by proteolysis into mature GP1,2, which consisted of two disulfide-linked cleavage products, the amino-terminal 140-kDa fragment GP1, and the carboxyl-terminal 26-kDa fragment GP2. GP1,2 was also identified in Ebola virions. Studies employing site-directed mutagenesis revealed that GP was cleaved at a multibasic amino acid motif located at positions 497 to 501 of the ORF. Cleavage was blocked by a peptidyl chloromethylketone containing such a motif. GP is cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin. This was indicated by the observation that cleavage did not occur when GP was expressed in furin-defective LoVo cells but that it was restored in these cells by vector-expressed furin. The Reston subtype, which differs from all other Ebola viruses by its low human pathogenicity, has a reduced cleavability due to a mutation at the cleavage site. As a result of these observations, it should now be considered that proteolytic processing of GP may be an important determinant for the pathogenicity of Ebola virus.

9600912|t|The central structural feature of the membrane fusion protein subunit from the Ebola virus glycoprotein is a long triple-stranded coiled coil.
9600912|a|The ectodomain of the Ebola virus Gp2 glycoprotein was solubilized with a trimeric, isoleucine zipper derived from GCN4 (pIIGCN4) in place of the hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N terminus. This chimeric molecule forms a trimeric, highly alpha-helical, and very thermostable molecule, as determined by chemical crosslinking and circular dichroism. Electron microscopy indicates that Gp2 folds into a rod-like structure like influenza HA2 and HIV-1 gp41, providing further evidence that viral fusion proteins from diverse families such as Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza), Retroviridae (HIV-1), and Filoviridae (Ebola) share common structural features, and suggesting a common membrane fusion mechanism.

9608279|t|[Microscopic study of species specific features of hemostatic impairment in Ebola virus infected monkeys].
9608279|a|Pathological changes were studied in the blood vessels of baboons, green, rhesus, and cynomolgus monkeys at the end-stage Ebola (Zaire) infection. Marked microvascular lesions (capillary stasis, blood engorgement, thrombosis with blood cells, neutrophil accumulation, endothelial edema) were found in all the monkeys. These changes clearly indicate impaired organ blood supply. Multiple hemorrhages were formed by diapedesis without vascular wall destruction. Fibrin deposition and thrombi were features of hemostatic impairment in green and rhesus monkeys. Fibrin deposition and hemorrhages were not found in the cynomolgus monkeys. The possible mechanisms responsible for end-stage shock in Ebola virus-infection associated with microcirculatory disorders.

9614872|t|Release of viral glycoproteins during Ebola virus infection.
9614872|a|Maturation and release of the Ebola virus glycoprotein GP were studied in cells infected with either Ebola or recombinant vaccinia viruses. Significant amounts of GP were found in the culture medium in nonvirion forms. The major form represented the large subunit GP1 that was shed after release of its disulfide linkage to the smaller transmembrane subunit GP2. The minor form were intact GP1,2 complexes incorporated into virosomes. Vector-expressed GP formed spikes morphologically indistinguishable from spikes on virus particles, indicating that spike assembly is independent of other viral proteins. Analysis of a truncation mutant revealed an early and almost complete release of GP1,2 molecules, showing that membrane anchoring is mediated by the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain of GP2. We have also compared wild-type virus which requires transcriptional editing for synthesis of full-length GP with a variant that does not depend on editing. Both viruses released comparable amounts of GP1, but the variant expressed only minute amounts of the small, soluble GP which is the expression product of nonedited mRNA species of the GP gene. The abundant shedding of soluble GP1 may play an important role in the immunopathology of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in experimentally and naturally infected hosts.

9633237|t|[Developing methods of specific heterologic immunoglobulins preparation for urgent prevention of Ebola fever and study of their properties].
9633237|a|Methods for preventing and treating Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever are not still available despite the fact that this virus have been studied for 20 years. Methods of immunization of the animals (sheep, goats) non-susceptible to Ebola virus with live virus preparations were developed to obtain the hyperimmune anti-Ebola virus sera required to have highly immune antivirus gamma-globulins. These methods made it possible to obtain the immune sera having high virus-neutralizing antibodies. Caprine immunoglobulins were obtained from sera by fractionation of immune sera by Kohn's method. The neutralization indices of the immunoglobulins obtained were at least Ig. When administered in the first hours of infection, the protective effect of these preparations was shown on guinea pigs infected with LD50 of the strain pathogenic to the animals. Preclinical trials of these immunoglobulins on laboratory animals and clinical trials on volunteers were performed. The preparation was used as a preventive agent when accidents took place at the laboratory working with Ebola virus. The similar preparation from equine sera having high neutralizing and protective properties was elaborated at the Virological Center, Microbiological Institute, Russian Ministry of Defense. Its prophylactic efficiency was also shown in infected gamadrias.

24284388|t|Sustained protection against Ebola virus infection following treatment of infected nonhuman primates with ZMAb.
24284388|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is one of the most lethal filoviruses, with mortality rates of up to 90% in humans. Previously, we demonstrated 100% and 50% survival of EBOV-infected cynomologus macaques with a combination of 3 EBOV-GP-specific monoclonal antibodies (ZMAb) administered at 24 or 48 hours post-exposure, respectively. The survivors demonstrated EBOV-GP-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In order to evaluate whether the immune response induced in NHPs during the ZMAb treatment and EBOV challenge is sufficient to protect survivors against a subsequent exposure, animals that survived the initial challenge were rechallenged at 10 or 13 weeks after the initial challenge. The animals rechallenged at 10 weeks all survived whereas 4 of 6 animals survived a rechallenge at 13 weeks. The data indicate that a robust immune response was generated during the successful treatment of EBOV-infected NHPs with EBOV, which resulted in sustained protection against a second lethal exposure.

24333483|t|Structural characterization of the glycoprotein GP2 core domain from the CAS virus, a novel arenavirus-like species.
24333483|a|Fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is a necessary first step for infection by enveloped viruses and is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein. The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined "class I" glycoproteins adopt an alpha-helical "trimer-of-hairpins" conformation during the fusion pathway. Here, we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric alpha-helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2 despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the alpha-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate virus support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that, despite being primarily arenavirus like, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.

24367715|t|Vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccines protect nonhuman primates against Bundibugyo ebolavirus.
24367715|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for human use. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine vectors, which encode an EBOV glycoprotein in place of the VSV glycoprotein, have shown 100% efficacy against homologous Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) or Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) challenge in NHPs. In addition, a single injection of a blend of three rVSV vectors completely protected NHPs against challenge with SEBOV, ZEBOV, the former Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus, and Marburg virus. However, recent studies suggest that complete protection against the newly discovered Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) using several different heterologous filovirus vaccines is more difficult and presents a new challenge. As BEBOV caused nearly 50% mortality in a recent outbreak any filovirus vaccine advanced for human use must be able to protect against this new species. Here, we evaluated several different strategies against BEBOV using rVSV-based vaccines. Groups of cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated with a single injection of a homologous BEBOV vaccine, a single injection of a blended heterologous vaccine (SEBOV/ZEBOV), or a prime-boost using heterologous SEBOV and ZEBOV vectors. Animals were challenged with BEBOV 29-36 days after initial vaccination. Macaques vaccinated with the homologous BEBOV vaccine or the prime-boost showed no overt signs of illness and survived challenge. In contrast, animals vaccinated with the heterologous blended vaccine and unvaccinated control animals developed severe clinical symptoms consistent with BEBOV infection with 2 of 3 animals in each group succumbing. These data show that complete protection against BEBOV will likely require incorporation of BEBOV glycoprotein into the vaccine or employment of a prime-boost regimen. Fortunately, our results demonstrate that heterologous rVSV-based filovirus vaccine vectors employed in the prime-boost approach can provide protection against BEBOV using an abbreviated regimen, which may have utility in outbreak settings.

24461913|t|Vaccination with recombinant adenoviruses expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein elicits protection in the interferon alpha/beta receptor knock-out mouse.
24461913|a|The resistance of adult immunocompetent mice to infection with ebolaviruses has led to the development of alternative small animal models that utilise immunodeficient mice, for example the interferon alpha/beta receptor knock-out mouse (IFNR(-/-)). IFNR(-/-) mice have been shown to be susceptible to infection with ebolaviruses by multiple routes but it is not known if this murine model is suitable for testing therapeutics that rely on the generation of an immune response for efficacy. We have tested recombinant adenovirus vectors for their ability to protect IFNR(-/-) mice from challenge with Ebola virus and have analysed the humoral response generated after immunisation. The recombinant vaccines elicited good levels of protection in the knock-out mouse and the antibody response in IFNR(-/-) mice was similar to that observed in vaccinated wild-type mice. These results indicate that the IFNR(-/-) mouse is a relevant small animal model for studying ebolavirus-specific therapeutics.

24462697|t|Post-exposure efficacy of oral T-705 (Favipiravir) against inhalational Ebola virus infection in a mouse model.
24462697|a|Filoviruses cause disease with high case fatality rates and are considered biological threat agents. Licensed post-exposure therapies that can be administered by the oral route are desired for safe and rapid distribution and uptake in the event of exposure or outbreaks. Favipiravir or T-705 has broad antiviral activity and has already undergone phase II and is undergoing phase III clinical trials for influenza. Here we report the first use of T-705 against Ebola virus. T-705 gave 100% protection against aerosol Ebola virus E718 infection; protection was shown in immune-deficient mice after 14 days of twice-daily dosing. T-705 was also shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection in cell culture. T-705 is likely to be licensed for use against influenza in the near future and could also be used with a new indication for filovirus infection.

24473128|t|Comprehensive functional analysis of N-linked glycans on Ebola virus GP1.
24473128|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires the virion surface-associated glycoprotein (GP) that is composed of a trimer of heterodimers (GP1/GP2). The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N- and O-linked glycans. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)-dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency. IMPORTANCE: Filovirus outbreaks occur sporadically throughout central Africa, causing high fatality rates among the general public and health care workers. These unpredictable hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are caused by multiple species of Ebola viruses, as well as Marburg virus. While filovirus vaccines and therapeutics are being developed, there are no licensed products. The sole viral envelope glycoprotein, which is a principal immunogenic target, contains a heavy shield of glycans surrounding the conserved receptor-binding domain. We find that disruption of this shield through targeted mutagenesis leads to an increase in cell entry, protease sensitivity, and antiserum/antibody sensitivity but is not sufficient to allow virion binding to the intracellular receptor NPC1. Therefore, our studies provide evidence that filoviruses maintain glycoprotein glycosylation to protect against proteases and antibody neutralization at the expense of efficient entry. Our results unveil interesting insights into the unique entry process of filoviruses and potential immune evasion tactics of the virus.

25426834|t|Chimpanzee Adenovirus Vector Ebola Vaccine.
25426834|a|BACKGROUND: The unprecedented 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) prompted an international response to accelerate the availability of a preventive vaccine. A replication-defective recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 3-vectored ebolavirus vaccine (cAd3-EBO), encoding the glycoprotein from Zaire and Sudan species, that offers protection in the nonhuman primate model, was rapidly advanced into phase 1 clinical evaluation. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of cAd3-EBO. Twenty healthy adults, in sequentially enrolled groups of 10 each, received vaccination intramuscularly in doses of 2x10(10) particle units or 2x10(11) particle units. Primary and secondary end points related to safety and immunogenicity were assessed throughout the first 8 weeks after vaccination; in addition, longer-term vaccine durability was assessed at 48 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: In this small study, no safety concerns were identified; however, transient fever developed within 1 day after vaccination in two participants who had received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose. Glycoprotein-specific antibodies were induced in all 20 participants; the titers were of greater magnitude in the group that received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose than in the group that received the 2x10(10) particle-unit dose (geometric mean titer against the Zaire antigen at week 4, 2037 vs. 331; P=0.001). Glycoprotein-specific T-cell responses were more frequent among those who received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose than among those who received the 2x10(10) particle-unit dose, with a CD4 response in 10 of 10 participants versus 3 of 10 participants (P=0.004) and a CD8 response in 7 of 10 participants versus 2 of 10 participants (P=0.07) at week 4. Assessment of the durability of the antibody response showed that titers remained high at week 48, with the highest titers in those who received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose. CONCLUSIONS: Reactogenicity and immune responses to cAd3-EBO vaccine were dose-dependent. At the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose, glycoprotein Zaire-specific antibody responses were in the range reported to be associated with vaccine-induced protective immunity in challenge studies involving nonhuman primates, and responses were sustained to week 48. Phase 2 studies and efficacy trials assessing cAd3-EBO are in progress.

25445348|t|Genome-wide analysis of codon usage bias in Ebolavirus.
25445348|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of the family Filoviridae and its genome consists of a 19-kb, single-stranded, negative sense RNA. EBOV is subdivided into five distinct species with different pathogenicities, being Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) the most lethal species. The interplay of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is expected to affect overall viral survival, fitness, evasion from host's immune system and evolution. In the present study, we performed comprehensive analyses of codon usage and composition of ZEBOV. Effective number of codons (ENC) indicates that the overall codon usage among ZEBOV strains is slightly biased. Different codon preferences in ZEBOV genes in relation to codon usage of human genes were found. Highly preferred codons are all A-ending triplets, which strongly suggests that mutational bias is a main force shaping codon usage in ZEBOV. Dinucleotide composition also plays a role in the overall pattern of ZEBOV codon usage. ZEBOV does not seem to use the most abundant tRNAs present in the human cells for most of their preferred codons.

25457751|t|Ebola virus convalescent blood products: where we are now and where we may need to go.
25457751|a|The world is regularly exposed to emerging infections with the potential to burst into a pandemic. One possible way to treat patients, when no other treatment is yet developed,is passive immunization performed by transfusing blood, plasma or plasma immunoglobul infractions obtained from convalescent donors who have recovered from the disease and have developed protective antibodies. The most recent on-going epidemic is caused by the Ebola virus, a filovirus responsible for Ebola virus disease, a severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever. Recently, the use of convalescent blood products was proposed by the WHO as one early option for treating patients with Ebola virus disease. This publication provides an overview of the various convalescent blood products and technological options that could theoretically be considered when there is a need to rely on this therapeutic approach.In countries without access to advanced blood-processing technologies, the choice may initially be restricted to convalescent whole blood or plasma. In technologically advanced countries, additional options for convalescent blood products are available, including virally inactivated plasma and fractionated immunoglobulins. The preparation of minipool immunoglobulins is also a realistic option to consider.

25473056|t|GB virus C coinfections in west African Ebola patients.
25473056|a|In 49 patients with known Ebola virus disease outcomes during the ongoing outbreak in Sierra Leone, 13 were coinfected with the immunomodulatory pegivirus GB virus C (GBV-C). Fifty-three percent of these GBV-C(+) patients survived; in contrast, only 22% of GBV-C(-) patients survived. Both survival and GBV-C status were associated with age, with older patients having lower survival rates and intermediate-age patients (21 to 45 years) having the highest rate of GBV-C infection. Understanding the separate and combined effects of GBV-C and age on Ebola virus survival may lead to new treatment and prevention strategies, perhaps through age-related pathways of immune activation.

25473261|t|What we know about ocular manifestations of Ebola.
25473261|a|Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a deadly disease caused by several species of ebolavirus. The current outbreak of 2014 is unique in that it has affected a greater number of people than ever before. It also has an unusual geographic distribution. Nonspecific findings such as fever and generalized weakness have traditionally been very common early in the acute phase. Ophthalmic manifestations have also been reported in significant numbers. Conjunctival injection has been identified in both the acute and late phases. Subconjunctival hemorrhage and excessive lacrimation have also been reported. Various forms of uveitis have been associated with the convalescent phase of the disease. When identified in conjunction with other signs such as fever, acute findings such as conjunctivitis may contribute to the diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Ideally, serologic testing should be performed prior to isolation and treatment of these individuals. Considering the prevalence of the current outbreak and the threat of transcontinental spread, ophthalmic health professionals need to be aware of the ocular manifestations of Ebola hemorrhagic fever as well as the associated signs and symptoms in order to prevent further spread.

25481284|t|Controlled viral glycoprotein expression as a safety feature in a bivalent rabies-ebola vaccine.
25481284|a|Using a recombinant rabies (RABV) vaccine platform, we have developed several safe and effective vaccines. Most recently, we have developed a RABV-based ebolavirus (EBOV) vaccine that is efficacious in nonhuman primates. One safety feature of this vaccine is the utilization of a live but replication-deficient RABV construct. In this construct, the RABV glycoprotein (G) has been deleted from the genome, requiring G trans complementation in order for new infectious viruses to be released from the initial infected cell. Here we analyze this safety feature of the bivalent RABV-based EBOV vaccine comprised of the G-deleted RABV backbone expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP). We found that, while the level of RABV genome in infected cells is equivalent regardless of G supplementation, the production of infectious virus is indeed restricted by the lack of G, and most importantly, that the presence of EBOV GP does not substitute for G. These findings further support the safety profile of this replication-deficient RABV-EBOV bivalent vaccine.

25481298|t|Ebola virus (EBOV) infection: Therapeutic strategies.
25481298|a|Within less than a year after its epidemic started (in December 2013) in Guinea, Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the filoviridae, has spread over a number of West-African countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia) and gained allures that have been unprecedented except by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although EBOV is highly contagious and transmitted by direct contact with body fluids, it could be counteracted by the adequate chemoprophylactic and -therapeutic interventions: vaccines, antibodies, siRNAs (small interfering RNAs), interferons and chemical substances, i.e. neplanocin A derivatives (i.e. 3-deazaneplanocin A), BCX4430, favipiravir (T-705), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and a variety of compounds that have been found to inhibit EBOV infection blocking viral entry or by a mode of action that still has to be resolved. Much has to be learned from the mechanism of action of the compounds active against VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), a virus belonging to the rhabdoviridae, that in its mode of replication could be exemplary for the replication of filoviridae.

25493109|t|Ebola Virus Disease: essential public health principles for clinicians.
25493109|a|Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) has become a public health emergency of international concern. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed guidance to educate and inform healthcare workers and travelers worldwide. Symptoms of EVD include abrupt onset of fever, myalgias, and headache in the early phase, followed by vomiting, diarrhea and possible progression to hemorrhagic rash, life-threatening bleeding, and multi-organ failure in the later phase. The disease is not transmitted via airborne spread like influenza, but rather from person-to-person, or animal to person, via direct contact with bodily fluids or blood. It is crucial that emergency physicians be educated on disease presentation and how to generate a timely and accurate differential diagnosis that includes exotic diseases in the appropriate patient population. A patient should be evaluated for EVD when both suggestive symptoms, including unexplained hemorrhage, AND risk factors within 3 weeks prior, such as travel to an endemic area, direct handling of animals from outbreak areas, or ingestion of fruit or other uncooked foods contaminated with bat feces containing the virus are present. There are experimental therapies for treatment of EVD virus; however the mainstay of therapy is supportive care. Emergency department personnel on the frontlines must be prepared to rapidly identify and isolate febrile travelers if indicated. All healthcare workers involved in care of EVD patients should wear personal protective equipment. Despite the intense media focus on EVD rather than other threats, emergency physicians must master and follow essential public health principles for management of all infectious diseases. This includes not only identification and treatment of individuals, but also protection of healthcare workers and prevention of spread, keeping in mind the possibility of other more common disease processes.

25494457|t|VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP-induced innate protection enhances natural killer cell activity to increase survival in a lethal mouse adapted Ebola virus infection.
25494457|a|Members of the species Zaire ebolavirus cause severe hemorrhagic fever with up to a 90% mortality rate in humans. The VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP vaccine has provided 100% protection in the mouse, guinea pig, and nonhuman primate (NHP) models, and has also been utilized as a post-exposure therapeutic to protect mice, guinea pigs, and NHPs from a lethal challenge of Ebola virus (EBOV). EBOV infection causes rapid mortality in human and animal models, with death occurring as early as 6 days after infection, suggesting a vital role for the innate immune system to control the infection before cells of the adaptive immune system can assume control. Natural killer (NK) cells are the predominant cell of the innate immune response, which has been shown to expand with VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP treatment. In the current study, an in vivo mouse model of the VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP post-exposure treatment was used for a mouse adapted (MA)-EBOV infection, to determine the putative VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP-induced protective mechanism of NK cells. NK depletion studies demonstrated that mice with NK cells survive longer in a MA-EBOV infection, which is further enhanced with VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP treatment. NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion was significantly higher with VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP treatment. Cell mediated cytotoxicity assays and perforin knockout mice experiments suggest that there are perforin-dependent and -independent mechanisms involved. Together, these data suggest that NK cells play an important role in VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP-induced protection of EBOV by increasing NK cytotoxicity, and IFN-gamma secretion.

25495064|t|Quantifying the epidemic spread of Ebola virus (EBOV) in Sierra Leone using phylodynamics.
25495064|a|Measuring epidemic parameters early in an outbreak is essential to inform control efforts. Using the viral genome sequence and collection date from 78 infections in the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Sierra Leone, we estimate key epidemiological parameters such as infectious period duration (approximately 71 hours) and date of the first case in Sierra Leone (approximately April 25th). We also estimate the effective reproduction number, Re, (approximately 1.26), which is the number of secondary infections effectively caused by an infected individual and accounts for public health control measures. This study illustrates that phylodynamics methods, applied during the initial phase of an outbreak on fewer and more easily attainable data, can yield similar estimates to count-based epidemiological studies.

25496121|t|What is Ebola?
25496121|a|On 23 March 2014, the World Health Organization first announced a new Ebola virus outbreak that started in December 2013 in the eastern part of the Republic of Guinea. Human infections shortly emerged in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. On 30 September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed through laboratory testing the first Ebola virus infection diagnosed in the USA, in a patient who travelled from West Africa to Texas. On 6 October 2014, the first human infection occurring outside of Africa was reported, in a Spanish nurse who treated two priests, both of whom died, and on 23 October 2014, the first human infection was reported in New York City. To date, the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak is the longest, largest, and most persistent one since 1976, when the virus was first identified in humans, and the number of human cases exceeded, as of mid-September 2014, the cumulative number of infections from all the previous outbreaks. The early clinical presentation overlaps with other infectious diseases, opening differential diagnosis difficulties. Understanding the transmission routes and identifying the natural reservoir of the virus are additional challenges in studying Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Ebola virus is as much a public health challenge for developing countries as it is for the developed world, and previous outbreaks underscored that the relative contribution of the risk factors may differ among outbreaks. The implementation of effective preparedness plans is contingent on integrating teachings from previous Ebola virus outbreaks with those from the current outbreak and with lessons provided by other infectious diseases, along with developing a multifaceted inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary framework that should be established and shaped by biomedical as well as sociopolitical sciences.

25501666|t|Ebola virus as a sexually transmitted infection.
25501666|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ongoing Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa is a major global health challenge. The main mode of transmission is through contact with bodily fluids and skin of those infected or who have died. This review was undertaken to consider the evidence for transmission by contact with bodily fluids occurring through sexual activity. RECENT FINDINGS: No cases in the previous 20 outbreaks or the current outbreak in West Africa have been shown to be sexually transmitted, although other types of viral haemorrhagic fever have had sexual transmission implicated. Ebola virus is found in sites and fluids associated with sexual activity but this occurs at different stages of the disease. Persistence in the convalescent period occurs in rectum, vagina and semen, with persistence in semen being longest of up to at least 101 days. Recommendations based on this data are that those recovering from Ebola virus disease should abstain from all sexual intercourse, or if this is not possible, use condoms, for 3 months after the onset of symptoms. SUMMARY: There is theoretical plausibility for sexual transmission of Ebola virus but there has been no evidence of this occurring. Further research is needed to consider if sexual activity contributes to the epidemic in order to inform individuals with regard to avoiding acquisition or transmission by those recovering from Ebola virus disease.

25512227|t|Could pharmacological curtailment of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway reverse the endothelial barrier dysfunction associated with Ebola virus infection?
25512227|a|Activation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway induces endothelial barrier dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, which is a hallmark of various life-threatening vascular pathologies. Therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathway have proven effective in the attenuation of vascular leakage observed in animal models of endotoxin-induced lung injury/sepsis, edema, autoimmune disorders, and stroke. These findings suggest that treatments targeting the ROCK pathway might be of benefit in the management of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), which is characterized by severe vascular leak, likely involving pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, released from virus-infected macrophages. In this paper, we review evidence from in vivo and in vitro models of vascular leakage, suggesting that the RhoA/ROCK pathway is an important therapeutic target for the reversal of the vascular permeability defects associated with EVD. Future studies should explore the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of RhoA/ROCK pathway on reversing the endothelial barrier dysfunction in animal models of EVD and other hemorrhagic fever virus infections as part of an adjunctive therapy. Such experimental studies should focus, in particular, on the small molecule fasudil (HA-1077), a derivative of isoquinoline, which is a safe and clinically approved inhibitor of ROCK, making it an excellent candidate in this context.

25514385|t|Characterization of clinical and immunological parameters during Ebola virus infection of rhesus macaques.
25514385|a|The rhesus macaque serves as an animal model for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. A thorough understanding of EBOV infection in this species would aid in further development of filovirus therapeutics and vaccines. In this study, pathological and immunological data from EBOV-infected rhesus macaques are presented. Changes in blood chemistries, hematology, coagulation, and immune parameters during infection, which were consistently observed in the animals, are presented. In an animal that survived challenge, a delay was observed in the detection of viral RNA and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which may have contributed to survival. Collectively, these data add to the body of knowledge regarding EBOV pathogenesis in rhesus macaques and emphasize the reproducibility of the rhesus macaque challenge model.

25522088|t|Update: ebola virus disease epidemic - West Africa, December 2014.
25522088|a|CDC is assisting ministries of health and working with other organizations to end the ongoing epidemic of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa. The updated data in this report were compiled from situation reports from the Guinea Interministerial Committee for Response Against the Ebola Virus, the World Health Organization, the Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Total case counts include all suspected, probable, and confirmed cases, which are defined similarly by each country. These data reflect reported cases, which make up an unknown proportion of all cases, and reporting delays that vary from country to country.

25522089|t|Challenges in responding to the ebola epidemic - four rural counties, Liberia, August-November 2014.
25522089|a|The first cases of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa were identified in Guinea on March 22, 2014. On March 30, the first Liberian case was identified in Foya Town, Lofa County, near the Guinean border. Because the majority of early cases occurred in Lofa and Montserrado counties, resources were concentrated in these counties during the first several months of the response, and these counties have seen signs of successful disease control. By October 2014, the epidemic had reached all 15 counties of Liberia. During August 27-September 10, 2014, CDC in collaboration with the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare assessed county Ebola response plans in four rural counties (Grand Cape Mount, Grand Bassa, Rivercess, and Sinoe, to identify county-specific challenges in executing their Ebola response plans, and to provide recommendations and training to enhance control efforts. Assessments were conducted through interviews with county health teams and health care providers and visits to health care facilities. At the time of assessment, county health teams reported lacking adequate training in core Ebola response strategies and reported facing many challenges because of poor transportation and communication networks. Development of communication and transportation network strategies for communities with limited access to roads and limited means of communication in addition to adequate training in Ebola response strategies is critical for successful management of Ebola in remote areas.

25522340|t|Ebola in children: epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis and outcomes.
25522340|a|Ebola virus disease is caused by a highly contagious and pathogenic threadlike RNA virus of the Filoviridae family. The index human case is usually a zoonosis that launches human-to-human transmission interface with varying levels of sustainability of the epidemic depending on the level of public health preparedness of the affected country and the Ebola virus strain. The disease affects all age groups in the population. Clinical diagnosis is challenging in index cases especially in the early stages of the disease when the presenting features are usually nonspecific and only similar to a flu-like illness. However, in the agonal stages, hemorrhage frequently occurs in a high proportion of cases. The diagnostic gold standard is by detecting the antigen using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates in the past 28 outbreaks since 1976 have ranged from 30% to 100% in different settings among adults, but lower mortality rates have been documented in children. This review aims to describe Ebola virus infection, clinical presentation, diagnosis and outcomes in children.

25530596|t|Physicians' obligations to patients infected with Ebola: echoes of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
25530596|a|Physicians across the United States are engaged in training in the identification, isolation, and initial care of patients with Ebola. Some will be asked to do more. The issue this viewpoint will address is the moral obligation of physicians to participate in these activities. In order to do so the implicit contract between society and its physicians will be considered, as will many of the arguments that are redolent of those that were litigated 30 years ago when acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was raising public fears to similar levels, and some physicians were publically proclaiming their unwillingness to render care to those individuals. We will build the case that if steps are taken to reduce risks-optimal personal protective equipment and training-to what is essentially the lowest possible level then rendering care should be seen as obligatory. If not, as in the AIDS era there will be an unfair distribution of risk, with those who take their obligations seriously having to go beyond their fair measure of exposure. It would also potentially undermine patients' faith in the altruism of physicians and thereby degrade the esteem in which our profession is held and the trust that underpins the therapeutic relationship. Finally there is an implicit contract with society. Society gives tremendously to us; we encumber a debt from all society does and offers, a debt for which recompense is rarely sought. The mosaic of moral, historical, and professional imperatives to render care to the infected all echoes the words of medicine's moral leaders in the AIDS epidemic. Arnold Relman perhaps put it most succinctly, "the risk of contracting the patient's disease is one of the risks that is inherent in the profession of medicine. Physicians who are not willing to accept that risk...ought not be in the practice of medicine."

25531344|t|Multiple circulating infections can mimic the early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers and possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the 2014 outbreak.
25531344|a|Lassa fever (LF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The LF program at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Eastern Sierra Leone currently provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year. Nearly two-thirds of suspected LF patients presenting to the LF Ward test negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV immunoglobulin M (IgM), and therefore are considered to have a non-Lassa febrile illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients in this study were generally severely ill, which accounts for their high case fatality rate of 36%. The current studies were aimed at determining possible causes of severe febrile illnesses in non-LF cases presenting to the KGH, including possible involvement of filoviruses. A seroprevalence survey employing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests revealed significant IgM and IgG reactivity against dengue virus, chikungunya virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Leptospira, and typhus. A polymerase chain reaction-based survey using sera from subjects with acute LF, evidence of prior LASV exposure, or NLFI revealed widespread infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. WNV RNA was detected in a subset of patients, and a 419 nt amplicon specific to filoviral L segment RNA was detected at low levels in a single patient. However, 22% of the patients presenting at the KGH between 2011 and 2014 who were included in this survey registered anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) IgG or IgM, suggesting prior exposure to this agent. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is already the deadliest and most widely dispersed outbreak of its kind on record. Serological evidence reported here for possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the current EVD outbreak supports genetic analysis that EBOV may have been present in West Africa for some time prior to the 2014 outbreak.

25532798|t|Small molecule inhibitors of ebola virus infection.
25532798|a|Ebola viruses are extremely virulent and highly transmissible. They are responsible for sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fevers with human mortality rates of up to 90%. No prophylactic or therapeutic treatments in the form of vaccine, biologicals or small molecule, currently exist. Yet, a wealth of antiviral research on ebola virus is being generated and potential inhibitors have been identified in biological screening and medicinal chemistry programs. Here, we detail the state-of-the-art in small molecule inhibitors of ebola virus infection, with >60 examples, including approved drugs, compounds currently in clinical trials, and more exploratory leads, and summarize the associated in vitro and in vivo evidence for their effectiveness.

25534190|t|Severe Ebola virus disease with vascular leakage and multiorgan failure: treatment of a patient in intensive care.
25534190|a|BACKGROUND: In the current epidemic of Ebola virus disease in western Africa, many aid workers have become infected. Some of these aid workers have been transferred to specialised hospitals in Europe and the USA for intensified treatment, providing the potential for unique insight into the clinical course of Ebola virus disease under optimised supportive measures in isolation units. METHODS: A 38-year-old male doctor who had contracted an Ebola virus infection in Sierra Leone was airlifted to University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, on day 5 after disease onset. Within 72 h of admission to the hospital's high-level isolation unit, the patient developed signs of severe multiorgan failure, including lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In addition to clinical parameters, the diagnostic work-up included radiography, ultrasound, pulse contour cardiac output technology, and microbiological and clinical chemistry analyses. Respiratory failure with pulmonary oedema and biophysical evidence of vascular leak syndrome needed mechanical ventilation. The patient received a 3 day treatment course with FX06 (MChE-F4Pharma, Vienna, Austria), a fibrin-derived peptide under clinical development for vascular leak syndrome. After FX06 administration and concurrent detection of Ebola-virus-specific antibodies and a fall in viral load, vascular leak syndrome and respiratory parameters substantially improved. We gave broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy and the patient needed intermittent renal replacement therapy. The patient fully recovered. FINDINGS: This case report shows the feasibility of delivery of successful intensive care therapy to patients with Ebola virus disease under biosafety level 4 conditions. INTERPRETATION: The effective treatment of vascular leakage and multiorgan failure by combination of ventilatory support, antibiotic treatment, and renal replacement therapy can sustain a patient with severe Ebola virus disease until virological remission. FX06 could potentially be a valuable agent in contribution to supportive therapy. FUNDING: University Hospital of Frankfurt.

25535021|t|A race for an Ebola vaccine: promises and obstacles.
25535021|a|While several impeding factors have limited Ebola vaccine development, the current epidemic has provided a surge which may lead to a record pace for a vaccine against Ebola. Consequently, multiple FDA trials are currently underway using two promising vaccine platforms; one has recently demonstrated durable immunity within non-human primates.

25540891|t|Safety and immunogenicity of Ebola virus and Marburg virus glycoprotein DNA vaccines assessed separately and concomitantly in healthy Ugandan adults: a phase 1b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
25540891|a|BACKGROUND: Ebola virus and Marburg virus cause serious disease outbreaks with high case fatality rates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two investigational DNA vaccines, one (EBO vaccine) encoding Ebola virus Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins and one (MAR) encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein. METHODS: RV 247 was a phase 1b, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Kampala, Uganda to examine the safety and immunogenicity of the EBO and MAR vaccines given individually and concomitantly. Healthy adult volunteers aged 18-50 years were randomly assigned (5:1) to receive three injections of vaccine or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with vaccine allocations divided equally between three active vaccine groups: EBO vaccine only, MAR vaccine only, and both vaccines. The primary study objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the vaccines, as assessed by local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. We also assessed immunogenicity on the basis of antibody responses (ELISA) and T-cell responses (ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining assays) 4 weeks after the third injection. Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00997607. FINDINGS: 108 participants were enrolled into the study between Nov 2, 2009, and April 15, 2010. All 108 participants received at least one study injection (including 100 who completed the injection schedule) and were included in safety and tolerability analyses; 107 for whom data were available were included in the immunogenicity analyses. Study injections were well tolerated, with no significant differences in local or systemic reactions between groups. The vaccines elicited antibody and T-cell responses specific to the glycoproteins received and we detected no differences between the separate and concomitant use of the two vaccines. 17 of 30 (57%, 95% CI 37-75) participants in the EBO vaccine group had an antibody response to the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein, as did 14 of 30 (47%, 28-66) in the group that received both vaccines. 15 of 30 (50%, 31-69) participants in the EBO vaccine group had an antibody response to the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein, as did 15 of 30 (50%, 31-69) in the group that received both vaccines. Nine of 29 (31%, 15-51) participants in the MAR vaccine groups had an antibody response to the Marburg glycoprotein, as did seven of 30 (23%, 10-42) in the group that received both vaccines. 19 of 30 (63%, 44-80) participants in the EBO vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein, as did 10 of 30 (33%, 17-53) in the group that received both vaccines. 13 of 30 (43%, 25-63) participants in the EBO vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein, as did 10 of 30 (33%, 17-53) in the group that received both vaccines. 15 of 29 (52%, 33-71) participants in the MAR vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Marburg glycoprotein, as did 13 of 30 (43%, 25-63) in the group that received both vaccines. INTERPRETATION: This study is the first Ebola or Marburg vaccine trial done in Africa, and the results show that, given separately or together, both vaccines were well tolerated and elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. These findings have contributed to the accelerated development of more potent Ebola virus vaccines that encode the same wild-type glycoprotein antigens as the EBO vaccine, which are being assessed during the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa.

25544306|t|Favipiravir: a new medication for the Ebola virus disease pandemic.
25544306|a|The purpose of this report is to advocate speedy approval and less stringent regulations for the use of experimental drugs such as favipiravir in emergencies. Favipiravir is a new antiviral medication that can be used in emerging viral pandemics such as Ebola virus, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, Lassa fever, and Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Although favipiravir is one of the choices for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus, several concerns exist. First, a clinical trial of favipiravir in patients infected with the Ebola virus has not yet been conducted, and further studies are required. Second, favipiravir has a risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. Therefore, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan has approved this medication with strict regulations for its production and clinical use. However, owing to the emerging Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, on August 15, 2014, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan approved the use of favipiravir, if needed.

25546984|t|[Modern threat of Ebola virus].
25546984|a|Since the detection of Ebola virus in 1976. recorded 13 major epidemics in Africa. The current threat in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone absorbs another victims and threatened pandemic. Picture of the disease is initially very non-characteristic (influenza-like symptoms) and quickly leads to dehydration, shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, which is responsible for high mortality. Lack of effective antibiotic therapy and vaccine hampers the existing situation. For this reason, there is an absolute necessity to introduce regimes sanitation, quarantine at the suspects and maintain the highest safety measures for emergency responders. Developed procedures require absolute compliance.

25547682|t|Nucleoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (indirect ELISA) for detecting antibodies specific to Ebola virus and Marbug virus.
25547682|a|Full-length nucleoproteins from Ebola and Marburg viruses were expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and nucleoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were established for the detection of antibodies specific to Ebola and Marburg viruses. The ELISAs were evaluated by testing antisera collected from rabbit immunized with Ebola and Marburg virus nucleoproteins. Although little cross-reactivity of antibodies was observed in anti-Ebola virus nucleoprotein rabbit antisera, the highest reactions to immunoglobulin G (IgG) were uniformly detected against the nucleoprotein antigens of homologous viruses. We further evaluated the ELISA's ability to detect antibodies to Ebola and Marburg viruses using human sera samples collected from individuals passing through the Guangdong port of entry. With a threshold set at the mean plus three standard deviations of average optical densities of sera tested, the ELISA systems using these two recombinant nucleoproteins have good sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate the usefulness of ELISA for diagnostics as well as ecological and serosurvey studies of Ebola and Marburg virus infection.

25552710|t|Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus display late cell entry kinetics: evidence that transport to NPC1+ endolysosomes is a rate-defining step.
25552710|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) causes hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality rates. During cellular entry, the virus is internalized by macropinocytosis and trafficked through endosomes until fusion between the viral and an endosomal membrane is triggered, releasing the RNA genome into the cytoplasm. We found that while macropinocytotic uptake of filamentous EBOV viruslike particles (VLPs) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) occurs relatively quickly, VLPs only begin to enter the cytoplasm after a 30-min lag, considerably later than particles bearing the influenza hemagglutinin or GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which enter through late endosomes (LE). For EBOV, the long lag is not due to the large size or unusual shape of EBOV filaments, the need to prime EBOV GP to the 19-kDa receptor-binding species, or a need for unusually low endosomal pH. In contrast, since we observed that EBOV entry occurs upon arrival in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive endolysosomes (LE/Lys), we propose that trafficking to LE/Lys is a key rate-defining step. Additional experiments revealed, unexpectedly, that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) S-mediated entry also begins only after a 30-min lag. Furthermore, although SARS does not require NPC1 for entry, SARS entry also begins after colocalization with NPC1. Since the only endosomal requirement for SARS entry is cathepsin L activity, we tested and provide evidence that NPC1(+) LE/Lys have higher cathepsin L activity than LE, with no detectable activity in earlier endosomes. Our findings suggest that both EBOV and SARS traffic deep into the endocytic pathway for entry and that they do so to access higher cathepsin activity. IMPORTANCE: Ebola virus is a hemorrhagic fever virus that causes high fatality rates when it spreads from zoonotic vectors into the human population. Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes severe respiratory distress in infected patients. A devastating outbreak of EBOV occurred in West Africa in 2014, and there was a significant outbreak of SARS in 2003. No effective vaccine or treatment has yet been approved for either virus. We present evidence that both viruses traffic late into the endocytic pathway, to NPC1(+) LE/Lys, in order to enter host cells, and that they do so to access high levels of cathepsin activity, which both viruses use in their fusion-triggering mechanisms. This unexpected similarity suggests an unexplored vulnerability, trafficking to NPC1(+) LE/Lys, as a therapeutic target for SARS and EBOV.

25565430|t|Ebola outbreak in rural West Africa: epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes.
25565430|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe Ebola cases in the district Ebola management centre of in Kailahun, a remote rural district of Sierra Leone, in terms of geographic origin, patient and hospitalisation characteristics, treatment outcomes and time from symptom onset to admission. METHODS: Data of all Ebola cases from June 23rd to October 5th 2014 were reviewed. Ebola was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Of 489 confirmed cases (51% male, median age 28 years), 166 (34%) originated outside Kailahun district. Twenty-eight (6%) were health workers: 2 doctors, 11 nurses, 2 laboratory technicians, 7 community health workers and 6 other cadres. More than 50% of patients had fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea/vomiting. An unusual feature was cough in 40%. Unexplained bleeding was reported in 5%. Outcomes for the 489 confirmed cases were 227 (47%) discharges, 259 (53%) deaths and 3 transfers. Case fatality in health workers (68%) was higher than other occupations (52%, P = 0.05). The median community infectivity time was 6.5 days for both general population and health workers (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: One in three admitted cases originated outside Kailahun district due to limited national access to Ebola management centres - complicating contact tracing, safe burial and disinfection measures. The comparatively high case fatality among health workers requires attention. The community infectivity time needs to be reduced to prevent continued transmission.
