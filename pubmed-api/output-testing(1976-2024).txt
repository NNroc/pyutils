102747|t|The pathology of experimental Ebola virus infection in monkeys.
102747|a|Six rhesus and two vervet monkeys were infected intraperitoneally with Ebola virus. They developed an acute haemorrhagic fever with skin rash 4 days later and died 6--12 days after infection. Histopathological lesions of acute necrosis were present in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs and testes. The presence of fibrin thrombi in several organs was suggestive of the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation during the infection.

106868|t|Ebola virus: a comparison, at ultrastructural level, of the behaviour of the Sudan and Zaire strains in monkeys.
106868|a|Histopathological and electron microscopical examination of human liver specimens collected during the Ebola haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan indicated that Zairean strains of the virus produced more extensive lesions. Experimental infection of rhesus monkeys wiht Zairean and Sudanese strains of Ebola virus produced similar changes to those found in man. In Zairean strain infections large numbers of virus particles were found in the liver, lung and spleen accompanied by extensive necrosis in the spleen. In Sudan strain infections particles were found only in the liver and in greatly reduced numbers. The main distinction lay in the high proportion of aberrant particles found with the Sudanese strain. The possibility of these being defective particles is discussed.

307455|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Sudan, 1976. Report of a WHO/International Study Team.
307455|a|A large outbreak of haemorrhagic fever (subsequently named Ebola haemorrhagic fever) occurred in southern Sudan between June and November 1976. There was a total of 284 cases; 67 in the source town of Nzara, 213 in Maridi, 3 in Tembura, and 1 in Juba. The outbreak in Nzara appears to have originated in the workers of a cotton factory. The disease in Maridi was amplified by transmission in a large, active hospital. Transmission of the disease required close contact with an acute case and was usually associated with the act of nursing a patient. The incubation period was between 7 and 14 days. Although the link was not well established, it appears that Nzara could have been the source of infection for a similar outbreak in the Bumba Zone of Zaire.In this outbreak Ebola haemorrhagic fever was a unique clinical disease with a high mortality rate (53% overall) and a prolonged recovery period in those who survived. Beginning with an influenza-like syndrome, including fever, headache, and joint and muscle pains, the disease soon caused diarrhoea (81%), vomiting (59%), chest pain (83%), pain and dryness of the throat (63%), and rash (52%). Haemorrhagic manifestations were common (71%), being present in half of the recovered cases and in almost all the fatal cases.Two post mortems were carried out on patients in November 1976. The histopathological findings resembled those of an acute viral infection and although the features were characteristic they were not exclusively diagnostic. They closely resembled the features described in Marburg virus infection, with focal eosinophilic necrosis in the liver and destruction of lymphocytes and their replacement by plasma cells. One case had evidence of renal tubular necrosis.Two strains of Ebola virus were isolated from acute phase sera collected from acutely ill patients in Maridi hospital during the investigation in November 1976. Antibodies to Ebola virus were detected by immunofluorescence in 42 of 48 patients in Maridi who had been diagnosed clinically, but in only 6 of 31 patients in Nzara. The possibility of the indirect immunofluorescent test not being sufficiently sensitive is discussed.Of Maridi case contacts, in hospital and in the local community, 19% had antibodies. Very few of them gave any history of illness, indicating that Ebola virus can cause mild or even subclinical infections. Of the cloth room workers in the Nzara cotton factory, 37% appeared to have been infected, suggesting that the factory may have been the prime source of infection.

307456|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire, 1976.
307456|a|Between 1 September and 24 October 1976, 318 cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Zaire. The outbreak was centred in the Bumba Zone of the Equateur Region and most of the cases were recorded within a radius of 70 km of Yambuku, although a few patients sought medical attention in Bumba, Abumombazi, and the capital city of Kinshasa, where individual secondary and tertiary cases occurred. There were 280 deaths, and only 38 serologically confirmed survivors.The index case in this outbreak had onset of symptoms on 1 September 1976, five days after receiving an injection of chloroquine for presumptive malaria at the outpatient clinic at Yambuku Mission Hospital (YMH). He had a clinical remission of his malaria symptoms. Within one week several other persons who had received injections at YMH also suffered from Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and almost all subsequent cases had either received injections at the hospital or had had close contact with another case. Most of these occurred during the first four weeks of the epidemic, after which time the hospital was closed, 11 of the 17 staff members having died of the disease. All ages and both sexes were affected, but women 15-29 years of age had the highest incidence of disease, a phenomenon strongly related to attendance at prenatal and outpatient clinics at the hospital where they received injections. The overall secondary attack rate was about 5%, although it ranged to 20% among close relatives such as spouses, parent or child, and brother or sister.Active surveillance disclosed that cases occurred in 55 of some 550 villages which were examined house-by-house. The disease was hitherto unknown to the people of the affected region. Intensive search for cases in the area of north-eastern Zaire between the Bumba Zone and the Sudan frontier near Nzara and Maridi failed to detect definite evidence of a link between an epidemic of the disease in that country and the outbreak near Bumba. Nevertheless it was established that people can and do make the trip between Nzara and Bumba in not more than four days: thus it was regarded as quite possible that an infected person had travelled from Sudan to Yambuku and transferred the virus to a needle of the hospital while receiving an injection at the outpatient clinic.Both the incubation period, and the duration of the clinical disease averaged about one week. After 3-4 days of non-specific symptoms and signs, patients typically experienced progressively severe sore throat, developed a maculopapular rash, had intractable abdominal pain, and began to bleed from multiple sites, principally the gastrointestinal tract. Although laboratory determinations were limited and not conclusive, it was concluded that pathogenesis of the disease included non-icteric hepatitis and possibly acute pancreatitis as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation.This syndrome was caused by a virus morphologically similar to Marburg virus, but immunologically distinct. It was named Ebola virus. The agent was isolated from the blood of 8 of 10 suspected cases using Vero cell cultures. Titrations of serial specimens obtained from one patient disclosed persistent viraemia of 10(6.5)-10(4.5) infectious units from the third day of illness until death on the eighth day. Ebola virus particles were found in formalin-

418537|t|Ebola haemorrhagic fever: experimental infection of monkeys.
418537|a|Experimental infection of rhesus and vervet monkeys with Ebola virus produced a uniformly fatal illness. The course of the disease resembled that found in man with weight loss, anorexia, fever, haemorrhages and skin rash being frequently seen. Viraemia was obvious within two days of infection and persisted until death which occurred between days five and eight. Virus was found in high concentrations in several organs but particularly in the liver, spleen, and lungs.

1299611|t|The envelope glycoprotein of Ebola virus contains an immunosuppressive-like domain similar to oncogenic retroviruses.
1299611|a|Genomic RNA of a Zaire strain of Ebola virus was cloned, and cDNA inserts specific for the glycoprotein gene were isolated and sequenced. The determined sequence has only one open reading frame encoding 318 amino acids and is part of ORF-4 on the plus RNA strand. The putative transcriptional stop site (3' AAUUCUUUUU 5') and the transcriptional start site (3' AACUACUUCUAAUU..5') were identified. Computer-assisted comparison of the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal part of protein encoded by ORF-4 of Ebola virus with sequences of the proteins present in the SWISSPROT and EMBL banks revealed significant homology with the 'immunosuppressive domain' of the p15E envelope proteins of various oncogenic retroviruses. The possible role of such a homology is discussed.

1572982|t|Enzyme immunosorbent assay for Ebola virus antigens in tissues of infected primates.
1572982|a|A sandwich enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) using a mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies for antigen capture and polyclonal hyperimmune rabbit anti-Ebola virus serum for antigen detection was developed and evaluated on the tissues of monkeys naturally or experimentally infected with strains of Ebola viruses. When compared with virus isolation, the antigen detection EIA was both sensitive and specific: 44 of 45 (97.7%) liver homogenates and 38 of 41 (92.7%) spleen homogenates that were culture positive and tested by both techniques were positive for viral antigen, while 85 of 87 (97.7%) culture-negative liver homogenates and 66 of 66 culture-negative spleen homogenates were found to be antigen negative. The assay, initially developed to detect antigens of prototype African strains of Ebola virus, reliably detected related strains of Ebola virus found during two recent outbreaks of Ebola virus infection among imported, quarantined Macaca fascicularis monkeys in the United States. The assay allows economical and rapid testing of large numbers of tissue specimens. Antigen was found in homogenates of spleen and liver and in serum.

1621890|t|Outbreak of fatal illness among captive macaques in the Philippines caused by an Ebola-related filovirus.
1621890|a|Following the detection of an Ebola-like virus in cynomolgus macaques recently imported into the United States from The Philippines, studies were initiated to document transmission at export facilities located in the latter country. At one export facility, 52.8% of 161 monkeys that died over a 2.5-month period were shown to be infected with this virus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antigen in liver homogenates. A case fatality rate of 82.4% was documented for the infected monkeys. The initial anti-viral antibody prevalence among the captive macaques at this facility was 25.9% (indirect fluorescent antibody titer greater than or equal to 1:16). Followup documented infection of 24.4% of initially seronegative animals and 8.7% of initially seropositive monkeys. Being held in a gang cage versus a single cage was found to be a significant risk factor for subsequent virus infection, and the presence of IFA antibody was shown to predict protection. This study documents unequivocally for the first time the presence of an Ebola-related filovirus in Asia.

1794619|t|Virus zoonoses and their potential for contamination of cell cultures.
1794619|a|Silent virus infections of laboratory animals present a human health hazard, from direct exposure and from contamination of biological products for human use. Here we report two recent examples. In 1989, an outbreak of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections was recognized among workers at a cancer research center after an animal caretaker developed viral meningitis. Investigation revealed that multiple tumor cell lines at the facility were infected with LCMV, as were research animals injected with these cell lines. Of 82 workers tested, eight (10%) were found to have been infected. The infected workers were more likely than other animal handlers to report handling athymic (nude) mice (p less than .0.007). The number of nude mice used in this facilty had increased five-fold in the previous year, possibly explaining the timing of the outbreak. This is the first reported LCMV outbreak since 1975, and the first to implicate nude mice as a source of human LCMV infections. In November 1989 and January 1990, infections caused by two distinct Ebola-like filoviruses were discovered in non-human primates at quarantine facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Although 22 persons were considered to have high- or medium-risk exposures for Ebola infection, no Ebola-compatible illnesses occurred. One of the medium-risk persons had Ebola IgG antibodies confirmed by IFA and Western blot. Rigorous use of barrier precautions may have limited exposure and infection with these filoviruses. In February 1990, new groups of filovirus-infected monkeys were identified in Virginia and in Texas. Seroconversion occurred in four animal handlers, including one to very high titer, but again no illness was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2749110|t|Firsthand clinical observations of hemorrhagic manifestations in Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Zaire.
2749110|a|About 5 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak of Ebola virus fever in Yambuku, Zaire, several acute cases of the disease were observed. All of those affected had the following common signs and symptoms: sudden onset of high fever, with chills, headache, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, sore throat, expressionless face, and profound prostration. In some cases, on around the fifth day of the acute phase, the appearance of an exanthematous rash on the trunk announced the hemorrhagic manifestations: hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, bleeding ulcerations in the mouth and on the lips, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, and melena; epistaxis, ear bleeding, hematuria, and postpartum hemorrhages were also reported. All these hemorrhagic cases had a fatal outcome within about a week. The hemorrhagic manifestations were less severe in the cases that occurred by the end of the outbreak than in the first reported cases. Hemorrhagic manifestations were less frequent and less severe, or even absent, in the nonfatal cases (convalescents, serologically confirmed). No biologic investigation of the hemostatic impairment could be performed under the emergency conditions of this field study.

4045253|t|Pathophysiology of shock and hemorrhage in a fulminating viral infection (Ebola).
4045253|a|Eleven rhesus monkeys were monitored intensively during experimental infection with Ebola virus. Prominent neutrophilia with left shift and lymphopenia were the earliest abnormalities and were statistically significant by day 4 (P less than .02 and P less than .01, respectively). By day 4 falls in platelet counts were not statistically significant, whereas in vitro platelet aggregation was markedly depressed, progressing rapidly to complete failure by the time of maximum illness. Intraplatelet protein studies suggested this event was the result of in vivo activation and degranulation. Coagulation cascade defects were mainly in the intrinsic system and were surprisingly mild, with no evidence of selective consumption or production deficit of factor VII or VIII. When the possibility of indirectly mediated damage to endothelium possibly by a nonspecific immune response was examined, weight loss was less severe in drug-treated monkeys, and all had detectable plasma prostacyclin metabolites, but there was no improvement in survival.

4067737|t|Ultrastructural pathology of experimental Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus infection.
4067737|a|The organs of monkeys infected with Ebola haemorrhagic fever were examined by light and electron microscopy during the acute stage of the disease. The virus caused focal coagulative necrosis in the liver, spleen, kidney, lung and testis and widespread mild vascular damage. In the brain there was intense congestion, with erythrocyte 'sludging', but no inflammatory reaction. There was significant injury to the microvasculature in all organs. Virus replicated in endothelial cytoplasm causing focal necrosis, separation of tight junctions and detachment from basement membranes. These changes were associated with oedema and haemorrhage, but though contributing to the hypovolaemic shock were not sufficiently extensive to account for the severity of vascular collapse. Renal involvement was also clinically important. Some renal cellular injury was caused by direct virus invasion of glomerular endothelium and tubular epithelium, but much tubular damage was probably due to ischaemia resulting from thrombosis in the peritubular capillaries. The virus also replicated in lymphocytes and monocytes and in interstitial cells of the testis. Since particles were not found in seminiferous epithelium, the degeneration of spermatogonia and spermatocytes was probably secondary to ischaemia.

6138602|t|Haematological and biochemical monitoring of Ebola infection in rhesus monkeys: implications for patient management.
6138602|a|Patients with severe viral infections such as Lassa or Ebola may be denied adequate laboratory investigations because of justifiable fears among laboratory staff. This study in monkeys was designed to provide comprehensive haematological and biochemical monitoring in a contained environment during all stages of Ebola infection. Marked neutrophilia, depletion of lymphocytes, and early failure of platelet aggregation preceded a consumption coagulopathy with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and failure of prostacyclin production by vascular endothelium. Liver dysfunction was moderate but in conjunction with the dehydration and hypoalbuminaemia could be expected to precipitate renal failure and shock. It seems reasonable to anticipate successful patient support with a patient management isolator and treatment with platelet transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and possibly prostacyclin when haemostasis is defective during this otherwise self-limiting illness.

6352735|t|Development of an immunofluorescence focus assay for Ebola virus.
6352735|a|A 48-h indirect immunofluorescence focus assay for the quantitation of Ebola virus was developed, utilizing HeLa-229 cell monolayers. The dose dependency and the sensitivity of this assay as compared with conventional assays are reported. This indirect immunofluorescence focus assay can be used as a rapid, quantitative test for the detection of Ebola virus, an agent from Africa known to cause hemorrhagic fever.

6827145|t|Comparative analysis of the structural polypeptides of Ebola viruses from Sudan and Zaire.
6827145|a|Polypeptide structural analyses were performed by tryptic peptide mapping to assess the relationship between isolates of Ebola virus obtained in Sudan and Zaire. The results of these analyses indicate (1) that the Sudan and Zaire isolates are unique viral agents, (2) that multiple isolates within each group bear close resemblance to one another, (3) that suggestive evidence exists of conservation of homologous structure in the VP-2 (virion protein no. 2) nucleocapsid proteins of these viruses, and (4) that protein differences between the two Ebola virus subtypes appear to reside in the VP-1 and VP-3 virion polypeptides.

7029731|t|Marburg virus disease. The diagnosis and management of suspected cases.
7029731|a|Marburg virus disease is an African disease of unknown epidemiology. The infection is pantropic and highly contagious. Haemorrhage and other features cause serious morbidity and high mortality, and early diagnosis is essential. Viral haemorrhagic fever is diagnosed clinically and confirmed by coagulation studies. Electron microscopy and serology are necessary for the identification of the virus, as Lassa and Ebola viruses (among other organisms) give similar symptoms, and Ebola virus is morphologically indistinguishable from Marburg virus. Treatment is essentially supportive. Patients and contacts must be isolated and monitored, and extreme precautions must be taken by hospital and laboratory staff to prevent their own infection.

7431486|t|Virion nucleic acid of Ebola virus.
7431486|a|The virion nucleic acid of Ebola virus consists of a single-stranded RNA with a molecular weight of approximately 4.0 x 10(6). The virion RNA did not bind to oligodeoxythymidylic acid-cellulose under conditions known to bind RNAs rich in polyadenylic acid and was not infectious under conditions which yielded infectious RNA from Sindbis virus, suggesting that Ebola virus virion nucleic acid is a negative-stranded RNA.

7441205|t|Ebola virus: identification of virion structural proteins.
7441205|a|Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified Ebola virus revealed the presence of four major virion structural proteins which we have designated VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) proteins were used as mol. wt. markers, and the virion proteins were found to have mol. wt. of 125000 (VP1), 104000 (VP2), 40000 (VP3) and 26000 (VP4). VP1 was labelled with glucosamine and is probably a glycoprotein. The density of the Ebola virion was approx. 1.14g/ml in potassium tartrate. Virus nucleocapsids with a density of 1.32g/ml in caesium chloride were released when virions were treated with detergents. Proteins VP2 and VP3 were consistently associated with released nucleocapsids and are probably the major structural nucleocapsid proteins analogous to the N protein of VSV. Protein VP4 was reduced or absent in released nucleocapsids and is probably analogous to the membrane (M) protein of VSV and similar viruses. The glycoprotein (VP1) is larger than the glycoprotein of any known negative-strand RNA virus and is not labelled well with 35S-methionine. VP1 is solubilized by detergent treatment, suggesting that it is a component of the virion spikes and analogous to the G protein of VSV. Our results, in conjunction with analysis of Ebola virion RNA (Regnery et al. 1980), strongly suggest that the virus is a negative-strand RNA virus and, along with marburg virus, may constitute a new taxon within this group.

7547435|t|Lethal experimental infections of rhesus monkeys by aerosolized Ebola virus.
7547435|a|The potential of aerogenic infection by Ebola virus was established by using a head-only exposure aerosol system. Virus-containing droplets of 0.8-1.2 microns were generated and administered into the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys via inhalation. Inhalation of viral doses as low as 400 plaque-forming units of virus caused a rapidly fatal disease in 4-5 days. The illness was clinically identical to that reported for parenteral virus inoculation, except for the occurrence of subcutaneous and venipuncture site bleeding and serosanguineous nasal discharge. Immunocytochemistry revealed cell-associated Ebola virus antigens present in airway epithelium, alveolar pneumocytes, and macrophages in the lung and pulmonary lymph nodes; extracellular antigen was present on mucosal surfaces of the nose, oropharynx and airways. Aggregates of characteristic filamentous virus were present within type I pneumocytes, macrophages, and air spaces of the lung by electron microscopy. Demonstration of fatal aerosol transmission of this virus in monkeys reinforces the importance of taking appropriate precautions to prevent its potential aerosol transmission to humans.

8237108|t|Sequence analysis of the Ebola virus genome: organization, genetic elements, and comparison with the genome of Marburg virus.
8237108|a|Sequence analysis of the second through the sixth genes of the Ebola virus (EBO) genome indicates that it is organized similarly to rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses and is virtually the same as Marburg virus (MBG). In vitro translation experiments and predicted amino acid sequence comparisons showed that the order of the EBO genes is: 3'-NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L. The transcriptional start and stop (polyadenylation) signals are conserved and all contain the sequence 3'-UAAUU. Three base intergenic sequences are present between the NP and VP35 genes (3'-GAU) and VP40 and GP genes (3'-AGC), and a large intergenic sequence of 142 bases separates the VP30 and VP24 genes. Novel gene overlaps were found between the VP35 and VP40, the GP and VP30, and the VP24 and L genes. Overlaps are 20 or 18 bases in length and are limited to the conserved sequences determined for the transcriptional signals. Stem-and-loop structures were identified in the putative (+) leader RNA and at the 5' end of each mRNA. Hybridization studies showed that a small second mRNA is transcribed from the glycoprotein gene, and is produced by termination of transcription at an atypical polyadenylation signal located in the middle of the coding region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a hydrophobic anchor sequence, and 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences showed that the structural proteins of EBO and MBG contain large regions of homology despite the absence of serologic cross-reactivity.

8257297|t|Ebola protein analyses for the determination of genetic organization.
8257297|a|Amino-acid sequencing of the purified major nucleoprotein (NP), VP35 and VP40 from purified Ebola virus proved that they are the protein products of the first three genes, and that the open reading frame (ORF) of the NP begins at nucleotide 470. Because of the many unusual features of the ORFs of Ebola virus, we thought that our conclusions should be substantiated. Comparisons of in vitro-translation products to purified viral proteins were used to demonstrate conclusively that the NP, VP35 and VP40 were the protein products of genes one, two, and three, respectively. Studies using antibodies to synthetic peptides matching the N- and C-termini of the deduced sequences from these genes confirmed these conclusions and that the ORF for the NP begins at nucleotide 470. Subsequent studies confirmed that VP30 is encoded by the fifth gene.

8482365|t|The VP35 and VP40 proteins of filoviruses. Homology between Marburg and Ebola viruses.
8482365|a|The fragments of genomic RNA sequences of Marburg (MBG) and Ebola (EBO) viruses are reported. These fragments were found to encode the VP35 and VP40 proteins. The canonic sequences were revealed before and after each open reading frame. It is suggested that these sequences are mRNA extremities and at the same time the regulatory elements for mRNA transcription. Homology between the MBG and EBO proteins was discovered.

8551825|t|Transmission of Ebola virus (Zaire strain) to uninfected control monkeys in a biocontainment laboratory.
8551825|a|Secondary transmission of Ebola virus infection in humans is known to be caused by direct contact with infected patients or body fluids. We report transmission of Ebola virus (Zaire strain) to two of three control rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that did not have direct contact with experimentally inoculated monkeys held in the same room. The two control monkeys died from Ebola virus infections at 10 and 11 days after the last experimentally inoculated monkey had died. The most likely route of infection of the control monkeys was aerosol, oral or conjunctival exposure to virus-laden droplets secreted or excreted from the experimentally inoculated monkeys. These observations suggest approaches to the study of routes of transmission to and among humans.

8553543|t|GP mRNA of Ebola virus is edited by the Ebola virus polymerase and by T7 and vaccinia virus polymerases.
8553543|a|The glycoprotein gene of Ebola virus contains a translational stop codon in the middle, thus preventing synthesis of full-length glycoprotein. Twenty percent of the mRNA isolated from Ebola virus-infected cells was shown to be edited, containing one additional nontemplate A in a stretch of seven consecutive A residues. Only the edited mRNA species encoded full-length glycoprotein, whereas the exact copies of the viral template coded for a smaller secreted glycoprotein. Expression of the glycoprotein by an in vitro transcription/translation system, by the vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase system, and by recombinant vaccinia virus revealed that full-length glycoprotein was synthesized not only when the edited glycoprotein gene (8A's) was used as a template for T7 and vaccinia virus polymerases, but also when the nonedited (genomic) glycoprotein gene was used. Analysis of mRNA produced by T7 and vaccinia virus polymerase from the 7A's construct revealed that 1-5% contained alterations at the same site that was also edited by the Ebola virus polymerase. Our data indicate that the editing site in the Ebola virus glycoprotein gene is recognized not only by Ebola virus polymerase but also by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases of different origin.

8622982|t|The virion glycoproteins of Ebola viruses are encoded in two reading frames and are expressed through transcriptional editing.
8622982|a|In late 1994 and early 1995, Ebola (EBO) virus dramatically reemerged in Africa, causing human disease in the Ivory Coast and Zaire. Analysis of the entire glycoprotein genes of these viruses and those of other EBO virus subtypes has shown that the virion glycoprotein (130 kDa) is encoded in two reading frames, which are linked by transcriptional editing. This editing results in the addition of an extra nontemplated adenosine within a run of seven adenosines near the middle of the coding region. The primary gene product is a smaller (50-70 kDa), nonstructural, secreted glycoprotein, which is produced in large amounts and has an unknown function. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that EBO virus subtypes are genetically diverse and that the recent Ivory Coast isolate represents a new (fourth) subtype of EBO virus. In contrast, the EBO virus isolate from the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, is virtually identical to the virus that caused a similar epidemic in Yambuku, Zaire, almost 20 years earlier. This genetic stability may indicate that EBO viruses have coevolved with their natural reservoirs and do not change appreciably in the wild.

8625857|t|Threat of Marburg and Ebola viral haemorrhagic fevers in Africa.
8625857|a|Marburg and Ebola viruses are members of the filovirus family that can be regarded as recently emerged. These viruses have caused sporadic outbreaks of fatal haemorrhagic disease in Africa, Europe and recently in the USA. The case fatality rates rank among the highest ranging from 33-80%. The mode of transmission of these viruses are clearly through close contact with blood and body fluids. Disease outbreaks have been amplified in hospital situations with poor blood precautions. In villages disease has been amplified through contamination with blood and fluids during nursing the sick and burial rituals. The source of the viruses has eluded discovery and new theories regarding the nature of these viruses are being entertained. The threat of new outbreaks in Africa is real since serological evidence of the presence of the virus has been documented in Kenya, Sudan, Zaire, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Cote-d'Ivoire and Gabon.

8678836|t|Ebola virus infection in guinea pigs: presumable role of granulomatous inflammation in pathogenesis.
8678836|a|An approach combining virology with light and electron microscopy was used to study the organs of guinea pigs during nine serial passages of Ebola virus, strain Zaire. It was observed that the wild type of Ebola virus causes severe granulomatous inflammation in the liver and reproduces in the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Based on morphological characterization, two types of virus-cell interactions were demonstrated. The obtained data evidenced for heterogeneity of the population of wild type of Ebola virus. The virus accumulated in the liver of the infected animals, and the lesions became more pronounced with passage. Degenerative changes appeared, and their severity was increased with passage in the other organs as well. The set of target cells diversified and, as a result, not only the MPS cells, but also hepatocytes, spongiocytes, endotheliocytes and fibroblasts became involved in the reproduction of Ebola virus. The possible role of granulomatous inflammation in the development of the adaptive mechanism of Ebola virus to guinea pigs is discussed.

8800793|t|Experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with Ebola-Reston filoviruses from the 1989-1990 U.S. epizootic.
8800793|a|This study describes the pathogenesis of the Ebola-Reston (EBO-R) subtype of Ebola virus for experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys. The disease course of EBO-R in macaques was very similar to human disease and to experimental diseases in macaques following EBO-Zaire and EBO-Sudan infections. Cynomolgus monkeys infected with EBO-R in this experiment developed anorexia, occasional nasal discharge, and splenomegaly, petechial facial hemorrhages and severe subcutaneous hemorrhages in venipuncture sites, similar to human Ebola fever. Five of the six EBO-R infected monkeys died, 8 to 14 days after inoculation. One survived and developed high titered neutralizing antibodies specific for EBO-R. The five acutely ill monkeys shed infectious virus in various bodily secretions. Further, abundant virus was visualized in alveolar interstitial cells and free in the alveoli suggesting the potential for generating infectious aerosols. Thus, taking precautions against aerosol exposures to filovirus infected primates, including humans, seems prudent. This experiment demonstrated that EBO-R was lethal for macaques and was capable of initiating and sustaining the monkey epizootic. Further investigation of this animal model should facilitate development of effective immunization, treatment, and control strategies for Ebola hemorrhagic fever.

8800795|t|Passive immunization of Ebola virus-infected cynomolgus monkeys with immunoglobulin from hyperimmune horses.
8800795|a|A commercially available immunoglobulin G (IgG) from horses, hyperimmunized to Ebola virus, was evaluated for its ability to protect cynomolgus monkeys against disease following i.m. inoculation with 1 000 PFU Ebola virus (Zaire '95 strain). Six monkeys were treated immediately after infection by i.m. infection of 6.0 ml IgG; these animals developed passive ELISA titers of 1:160 to 1:320 to Ebola, two days afer inoculation. However, the beneficial effects of IgG treatment were limited to a delay in onset of viremia and clinical signs, in comparison with untreated controls. The six IgG recipients had no detectable viremia day 5, in contrast with three virus infected controls whose viremias exceeded 7.0 log10 PFU/ml that day. The controls died on days 6, 6, and 7, while two IgG recipients died day 7 and the remaining 4 died day 8, all with high viremias. These results document that passively acquired antibody can have a beneficial effect in reducing the viral burden in Ebola-infected primates; however, effective treatment of human patients may require antibodies with higher specific activities and more favorable pharmacokinetic properties than the presently available equine IgG.

8800808|t|Emerging and reemerging of filoviruses.
8800808|a|Filoviruses are causative agents of a hemorrhagic fever in man with mortalities ranging from 22 to 88%. They are enveloped, nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses and are separated into two types, Marburg and Ebola, which can be serologically, biochemically and genetically distinguished. In general, there is little genetic variability among viruses belonging to the Marburg type. The Ebola type, however, is subdivided into at least three distinct subtypes. Marburg virus was first isolated during an outbreak in Europe in 1967. Ebola virus emerged in 1976 as the causative agent of two simultaneous outbreaks in southern Sudan and northern Zaire. The reemergence of Ebola, subtype Zaire, in Kikwit 1995 caused a worldwide sensation, since it struck after a sensibilization on the danger of Ebola virus disease. Person-to-person transmission by intimate contact is the main route of infection, but transmission by droplets and small aerosols among infected individuals is discussed. The natural reservoir for filoviruses remains a mystery. Filoviruses are prime examples for emerging pathogens. Factors that may be involved in emergence are international commerce and travel, limited experience in diagnosis and case management, import of nonhuman primates, and the potential of filoviruses for rapid evolution.

8837880|t|Differentiation of filoviruses by electron microscopy.
8837880|a|Cultured monolayers of MA-104, Vero 76, SW-13, and DBS-FRhL-2 cells were infected with Marburg (MBG), Ebola-Sudan (EBO-S), Ebola-Zaire (EBO-Z), and Ebola-Reston (EBO-R) viruses (Filoviridae, Filovirus) and examined by electron microscopy to provide ultrastructural details of morphology and morphogenesis of these potential human pathogens. Replication of each filovirus was seen in all cell systems employed. Filoviral particles appeared to enter host cells by endocytosis. Filoviruses showed a similar progression of morphogenic events, from the appearance of nascent intracytoplasmic viral inclusions to formation of mature virions budded through plasma membranes, regardless of serotype or host cell. However, ultrastructural differences were demonstrated between MBG and other filoviruses. MBG virions recovered from culture fluids were uniformly shorter in mean unit length than EBO-S, EBO-Z, or EBO-R particles. Examination of filovirus-infected cells revealed that intermediate MBG inclusions were morphologically distinct from EBO-S, EBO-Z, and EBO-R inclusions. No structural difference of viral inclusion material was observed among EBO-S, EBO-Z, and EBO-R. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the filoviral matrix protein (VP40) and nucleoprotein (NP) accumulated in EBO-Z inclusions, and were closely associated during viral morphogenesis. These details facilitate the efficient and definitive diagnosis of filoviral infections by electron microscopy.

8935292|t|Ebola virus infection: an overview.
8935292|a|The current outbreak of the Ebola virus infection in Africa has yet again proven that highly dangerous diseases that are transmitted via the blood-borne route may be endemic in some parts of the world and may emerge as sporadic outbreaks causing worldwide concern. Health care professionals are at the forefront of combatting these diseases and treating infected individuals. Though dental professionals are unlikely to be directly involved in the management of such acute infections, with very high mortality rates, they may encounter patients seeking dental treatment who are either from, or who have recently toured the endemic disease areas. This overview, therefore, is a thumb nail sketch of the Ebola virus infection and its implications for dentistry.

8938109|t|A novel hypothesis to explain the hemorrhagic and connective tissue manifestations of Ebola virus infection.
8938109|a|The hemorrhagic and connective tissue complications of infection with Ebola virus are poorly understood. While searching for homologies and motifs of the aortic aneurysm-associated autoantigenic protein 40 kDa (AAAP-40), we have noted some short sequences (possibly shared epitopes) that occur in the envelope glycoprotein (40 kDa) of the Ebola virus. As a first step toward determining whether molecular mimicry of human matrix proteins by the Ebola virus protein might explain some of the severe connective tissue manifestations of infection, we have tested whether immunoglobulin (IgG) purified from the sera of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are immunoreactive with the 40-kDa protein of the Ebola virus. Immunoblots of soluble Ebola proteins (strain Mayinga/Zaire) were probed with IgG's purified from the sera of eight patients with AAA and two healthy young control volunteers. The proteins were also probed with IgG extracted from the walls of two surgical aneurysm specimens. Serum IgG from eight consecutively studied AAA patients was immunoreactive with an Ebola virus protein of 40 kDa, consistent with the envelope glycoprotein. IgG's extracted from the walls of two AAAs were also reactive. The control sera were not reactive. In addition to the Ebola sequences in AAAP-40, an Ebola sequence also occurs in the microfibril-associated glycoprotein-4 (MAGP-4), which is distributed ubiquitously throughout connective tissue with elastin. We hypothesize that the catastrophic hemorrhagic and connective tissue complications of Ebola virus infection may be the result of these shared epitopes.

8969248|t|Experimental inoculation of plants and animals with Ebola virus.
8969248|a|Thirty-three varieties of 24 species of plants and 19 species of vertebrates and invertebrates were experimentally inoculated with Ebola Zaire virus. Fruit and insectivorous bats supported replication and circulation of high titers of virus without necessarily becoming ill; deaths occurred only among bats that had not adapted to the diet fed in the laboratory.

9035363|t|Computer simulations of proteolysis of Marburg and Ebola-Zaire filovirus coded proteins to generate nonapeptides with motifs of known HLA class I haplotypes and detection of antigenic domains in the viral glycoproteins.
9035363|a|The primary amino acid sequences of the proteins coded by Marburg and Ebola-Zaire filoviruses were studied by computer programs to search for putative proteolytic cleavages which yield nonapeptides with motifs of binding to known HLA class I haplotypes. The computer analyses predicted that numerous nonapeptides with motifs to bind HLA class I A68 and A2 haplotypes were detected. A few nonapeptides with motifs HLA class I A24, B8, B27 and B35 were predicted in Marburg virus proteins. A similar finding is reported for Ebola-Zaire viral proteins (the viral polymerase was not studied). The search for antigenic domains that may induce the humoral immune response in the viral glycoproteins was based on computer analyses of the physical properties and antigenicity predictions of amino acids in certain domains of the primary amino acid sequences. Twelve putative antigenic domains were detected in Marburg virus glycoprotein and 11 putative antigenic domains in Ebola-Zaire virus glycoprotein. Despite the marked differences in the primary amino acid sequences in the putative antigenic domains of the two viral glycoproteins, 8 antigenic domains were found to have similar locations in the viral glycoproteins of the two viruses. Each pair of antigenic domains resemble each other in the physical properties of the amino acids that are different. These computer analyses may provide an approach to developing synthetic peptides capable of induction of both the cellular and humoral responses to protect against infection with Marburg or Ebola viruses.

9278604|t|Emerging and reemerging infections. Progress and challenges in the subspecialty of infectious disease pathology.
9278604|a|Emerging and reemerging infections are attracting greater attention from the public health and medical communities. Pathologists and other physicians are increasingly aware of the importance of the subspecialty of infectious disease pathology as a tool for diagnosis, surveillance, and research of emerging infections. In this communication, we describe the role that infectious disease pathologists have played during the last 2 years in broadening our understanding of selected emerging infections, including such examples as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, leptospirosis, microsporidiosis, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and cyclosporiasis. The significance of providing pathology services, especially the autopsy, to patients with potentially hazardous communicable diseases is discussed with the supposition that it is unethical to exclude or withhold health care from a patient based on his or her underlying disease or on risk factors for acquiring a disease. The increasing occurrence of infectious diseases imported into the United States and other nations, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 group O, dengue fever, tuberculosis, malaria, diphtheria and cholera in immigrants and travelers, and Ebola virus in nonhuman primates, emphasizes the necessity for pathologists of having competence with infectious disease pathology. It is critical that new generations of pathologists not only be trained in the subspecialty of infectious disease pathology, but that they also be willing participants in the diagnosis and investigation of infectious diseases. The lack of training programs for infectious disease pathologists, as well as the deficiency in infectious disease pathology support for ongoing and future epidemiologic investigations and research, has led to the broadening of pathology services and initiation of a dedicated section of Infectious Disease Pathology at one of the nation's premier public health institutions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga. Together with preexisting groups of medical and veterinary infectious disease pathologists at universities, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and the National Institutes of Health, this new program will significantly strengthen the capability of the United States to respond to future challenges of emerging and reemerging infections, both in this country and abroad.

9405687|t|A system for functional analysis of Ebola virus glycoprotein.
9405687|a|Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, resulting in mortality rates of up to 90%. Studies of this virus have been hampered by its extraordinary pathogenicity, which requires biosafety level 4 containment. To circumvent this problem, we developed a novel complementation system for functional analysis of Ebola virus glycoproteins. It relies on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that contains the green fluorescent protein gene instead of the receptor-binding G protein gene (VSVDeltaG*). Herein we show that Ebola Reston virus glycoprotein (ResGP) is efficiently incorporated into VSV particles. This recombinant VSV with integrated ResGP (VSVDeltaG*-ResGP) infected primate cells more efficiently than any of the other mammalian or avian cells examined, in a manner consistent with the host range tropism of Ebola virus, whereas VSVDeltaG* complemented with VSV G protein (VSVDeltaG*-G) efficiently infected the majority of the cells tested. We also tested the utility of this system for investigating the cellular receptors for Ebola virus. Chemical modification of cells to alter their surface proteins markedly reduced their susceptibility to VSVDeltaG*-ResGP but not to VSVDeltaG*-G. These findings suggest that cell surface glycoproteins with N-linked oligosaccharide chains contribute to the entry of Ebola viruses, presumably acting as a specific receptor and/or cofactor for virus entry. Thus, our VSV system should be useful for investigating the functions of glycoproteins from highly pathogenic viruses or those incapable of being cultured in vitro.

9427604|t|Immunization for Ebola virus infection.
9427604|a|Infection by Ebola virus causes rapidly progressive, often fatal, symptoms of fever, hemorrhage and hypotension. Previous attempts to elicit protective immunity for this disease have not met with success. We report here that protection against the lethal effects of Ebola virus can be achieved in an animal model by immunizing with plasmids encoding viral proteins. We analyzed immune responses to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the secreted or transmembrane forms of the glycoprotein (sGP or GP) and their ability to protect against infection in a guinea pig infection model analogous to the human disease. Protection was achieved and correlated with antibody titer and antigen-specific T-cell responses to sGP or GP. Immunity to Ebola virus can therefore be developed through genetic vaccination and may facilitate efforts to limit the spread of this disease.

9448698|t|Variation in the glycoprotein and VP35 genes of Marburg virus strains.
9448698|a|Marburg virus, the prototype of the family Filoviridae, differs genetically, serologically, and morphologically from Ebola viruses. To better define the genetic variation within the species, VP35 and glycoprotein (GP) genes of representative human isolates from four known episodes of Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever were analyzed. The percentage nucleotide differences in the GP gene coding regions of Marburg viruses (0.1-21%) was nearly equal to the percentage amino acid changes (0-23%), while the percentage nucleotide differences in VP35 coding regions (0.3-20.9%) were higher than the percentage amino acid changes (0.9-6.1%), indicating a greater number of nonsynonymous changes occurring in the GP gene. The higher variation in the GP gene and the corresponding protein, especially those changes in the variable middle region of the GP, suggests that the variability may be the result of responses to natural host pressures. Analysis of the GP gene open reading frame shows a nonrandom distribution of nonsynonymous mutations that may indicate positive Darwinian selection is operating within the variable region. A heptad repeat region and an adjoining predicted fusion peptide are found in the C-terminal third of Marburg virus GPs, as has been previously shown for Ebola virus, and are similar to those found in transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses. Comparative analyses showed that there are two lineages within the Marburg virus species of filoviruses. The most recent isolate from Kenya (1987) represents a separate genetic lineage within the Marburg virus species (21-23% amino acid difference). However, this lineage likely does not represent a separate Marburg subtype, as the extent of divergence is less than that separating Ebola virus subtypes.

9461435|t|Distinct cellular interactions of secreted and transmembrane Ebola virus glycoproteins.
9461435|a|The mechanisms by which Ebola virus evades detection and infects cells to cause hemorrhagic fever have not been defined, though its glycoprotein, synthesized in either a secreted or transmembrane form, is likely involved. Here the secreted glycoprotein was found to interact with neutrophils through CD16b, the neutrophil-specific form of the Fc gamma receptor III, whereas the transmembrane glycoprotein was found to interact with endothelial cells but not neutrophils. A murine retroviral vector pseudotyped with the transmembrane glycoprotein preferentially infected endothelial cells. Thus, the secreted glycoprotein inhibits early neutrophil activation, which likely affects the host response to infection, whereas binding of the transmembrane glycoprotein to endothelial cells may contribute to the hemorrhagic symptoms of this disease.

9499027|t|Phosphatidylinositol-dependent membrane fusion induced by a putative fusogenic sequence of Ebola virus.
9499027|a|The membrane-interacting abilities of three sequences representing the putative fusogenic subdomain of the Ebola virus transmembrane protein have been investigated. In the presence of calcium, the sequence EBO(GE) (GAAIGLAWIPYFGPAAE) efficiently fused unilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol (molar ratio, 2:1:1:0.5), a mixture that roughly resembles the lipid composition of the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Analysis of the lipid dependence of the process demonstrated that the fusion activity of EBO(GE) was promoted by phosphatidylinositol but not by other acidic phospholipids. In comparison, EBO(EA) (EGAAIGLAWIPYFGPAA) and EBO(EE) (EGAAIGLAWIPYFGPAAE) sequences, which are similar to EBO(GE) except that they bear the negatively charged glutamate residue at the N terminus and at both the N and C termini, respectively, induced fusion to a lesser extent. As revealed by binding experiments, the glutamate residue at the N terminus severely impaired peptide-vesicle interaction. In addition, the fusion-competent EBO(GE) sequence did not associate significantly with vesicles lacking phosphatidylinositol. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching by vesicles containing brominated phospholipids indicated that the EBO(GE) peptide penetrated to the acyl chain level only when the membranes contained phosphatidylinositol. We conclude that binding and further penetration of the Ebola virus putative fusion peptide into membranes might be governed by the nature of the N-terminal residue and by the presence of phosphatidylinositol in the target membrane. Moreover, since insertion of such a peptide leads to membrane destabilization and fusion, the present data would be compatible with the involvement of this sequence in Ebola virus fusion.

9525641|t|Characterization of Ebola virus entry by using pseudotyped viruses: identification of receptor-deficient cell lines.
9525641|a|Studies analyzing Ebola virus replication have been severely hampered by the extreme pathogenicity of this virus. To permit analysis of the host range and function of the Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ebo-GP), we have developed a system for pseudotyping these glycoproteins into murine leukemia virus (MLV). This pseudotyped virus, MLV(Ebola), can be readily concentrated to titers which exceed 5 x 10(6) infectious units/ml and is effectively neutralized by antibodies specific for Ebo-GP. Analysis of MLV(Ebola) infection revealed that the host range conferred by Ebo-GP is very broad, extending to cells of a variety of species. Notably, all lymphoid cell lines tested were completely resistant to infection; we speculate that this is due to the absence of a cellular receptor for Ebo-GP on B and T cells. The generation of high-titer MLV(Ebola) pseudotypes will be useful for the analysis of immune responses to Ebola virus infection, development of neutralizing antibodies, analysis of glycoprotein function, and isolation of the cellular receptor(s) for the Ebola virus.

9576958|t|Processing of the Ebola virus glycoprotein by the proprotein convertase furin.
9576958|a|In the present study, we have investigated processing and maturation of the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus. When GP expressed from vaccinia virus vectors was analyzed by pulse-chase experiments, the mature form and two different precursors were identified. First, the endoplasmic reticulum form preGPer, full-length GP with oligomannosidic N-glycans, was detected. preGPer (110 kDa) was replaced by the Golgi-specific form preGP (160 kDa), full-length GP containing mature carbohydrates. preGP was finally converted by proteolysis into mature GP1,2, which consisted of two disulfide-linked cleavage products, the amino-terminal 140-kDa fragment GP1, and the carboxyl-terminal 26-kDa fragment GP2. GP1,2 was also identified in Ebola virions. Studies employing site-directed mutagenesis revealed that GP was cleaved at a multibasic amino acid motif located at positions 497 to 501 of the ORF. Cleavage was blocked by a peptidyl chloromethylketone containing such a motif. GP is cleaved by the proprotein convertase furin. This was indicated by the observation that cleavage did not occur when GP was expressed in furin-defective LoVo cells but that it was restored in these cells by vector-expressed furin. The Reston subtype, which differs from all other Ebola viruses by its low human pathogenicity, has a reduced cleavability due to a mutation at the cleavage site. As a result of these observations, it should now be considered that proteolytic processing of GP may be an important determinant for the pathogenicity of Ebola virus.

9600912|t|The central structural feature of the membrane fusion protein subunit from the Ebola virus glycoprotein is a long triple-stranded coiled coil.
9600912|a|The ectodomain of the Ebola virus Gp2 glycoprotein was solubilized with a trimeric, isoleucine zipper derived from GCN4 (pIIGCN4) in place of the hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N terminus. This chimeric molecule forms a trimeric, highly alpha-helical, and very thermostable molecule, as determined by chemical crosslinking and circular dichroism. Electron microscopy indicates that Gp2 folds into a rod-like structure like influenza HA2 and HIV-1 gp41, providing further evidence that viral fusion proteins from diverse families such as Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza), Retroviridae (HIV-1), and Filoviridae (Ebola) share common structural features, and suggesting a common membrane fusion mechanism.

9614872|t|Release of viral glycoproteins during Ebola virus infection.
9614872|a|Maturation and release of the Ebola virus glycoprotein GP were studied in cells infected with either Ebola or recombinant vaccinia viruses. Significant amounts of GP were found in the culture medium in nonvirion forms. The major form represented the large subunit GP1 that was shed after release of its disulfide linkage to the smaller transmembrane subunit GP2. The minor form were intact GP1,2 complexes incorporated into virosomes. Vector-expressed GP formed spikes morphologically indistinguishable from spikes on virus particles, indicating that spike assembly is independent of other viral proteins. Analysis of a truncation mutant revealed an early and almost complete release of GP1,2 molecules, showing that membrane anchoring is mediated by the carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain of GP2. We have also compared wild-type virus which requires transcriptional editing for synthesis of full-length GP with a variant that does not depend on editing. Both viruses released comparable amounts of GP1, but the variant expressed only minute amounts of the small, soluble GP which is the expression product of nonedited mRNA species of the GP gene. The abundant shedding of soluble GP1 may play an important role in the immunopathology of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in experimentally and naturally infected hosts.

24284388|t|Sustained protection against Ebola virus infection following treatment of infected nonhuman primates with ZMAb.
24284388|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is one of the most lethal filoviruses, with mortality rates of up to 90% in humans. Previously, we demonstrated 100% and 50% survival of EBOV-infected cynomologus macaques with a combination of 3 EBOV-GP-specific monoclonal antibodies (ZMAb) administered at 24 or 48 hours post-exposure, respectively. The survivors demonstrated EBOV-GP-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In order to evaluate whether the immune response induced in NHPs during the ZMAb treatment and EBOV challenge is sufficient to protect survivors against a subsequent exposure, animals that survived the initial challenge were rechallenged at 10 or 13 weeks after the initial challenge. The animals rechallenged at 10 weeks all survived whereas 4 of 6 animals survived a rechallenge at 13 weeks. The data indicate that a robust immune response was generated during the successful treatment of EBOV-infected NHPs with EBOV, which resulted in sustained protection against a second lethal exposure.

24333483|t|Structural characterization of the glycoprotein GP2 core domain from the CAS virus, a novel arenavirus-like species.
24333483|a|Fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is a necessary first step for infection by enveloped viruses and is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein. The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined "class I" glycoproteins adopt an alpha-helical "trimer-of-hairpins" conformation during the fusion pathway. Here, we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric alpha-helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2 despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the alpha-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate virus support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that, despite being primarily arenavirus like, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.

24367715|t|Vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccines protect nonhuman primates against Bundibugyo ebolavirus.
24367715|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs). Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for human use. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine vectors, which encode an EBOV glycoprotein in place of the VSV glycoprotein, have shown 100% efficacy against homologous Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) or Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) challenge in NHPs. In addition, a single injection of a blend of three rVSV vectors completely protected NHPs against challenge with SEBOV, ZEBOV, the former Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus, and Marburg virus. However, recent studies suggest that complete protection against the newly discovered Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) using several different heterologous filovirus vaccines is more difficult and presents a new challenge. As BEBOV caused nearly 50% mortality in a recent outbreak any filovirus vaccine advanced for human use must be able to protect against this new species. Here, we evaluated several different strategies against BEBOV using rVSV-based vaccines. Groups of cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated with a single injection of a homologous BEBOV vaccine, a single injection of a blended heterologous vaccine (SEBOV/ZEBOV), or a prime-boost using heterologous SEBOV and ZEBOV vectors. Animals were challenged with BEBOV 29-36 days after initial vaccination. Macaques vaccinated with the homologous BEBOV vaccine or the prime-boost showed no overt signs of illness and survived challenge. In contrast, animals vaccinated with the heterologous blended vaccine and unvaccinated control animals developed severe clinical symptoms consistent with BEBOV infection with 2 of 3 animals in each group succumbing. These data show that complete protection against BEBOV will likely require incorporation of BEBOV glycoprotein into the vaccine or employment of a prime-boost regimen. Fortunately, our results demonstrate that heterologous rVSV-based filovirus vaccine vectors employed in the prime-boost approach can provide protection against BEBOV using an abbreviated regimen, which may have utility in outbreak settings.

24461913|t|Vaccination with recombinant adenoviruses expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein elicits protection in the interferon alpha/beta receptor knock-out mouse.
24461913|a|The resistance of adult immunocompetent mice to infection with ebolaviruses has led to the development of alternative small animal models that utilise immunodeficient mice, for example the interferon alpha/beta receptor knock-out mouse (IFNR(-/-)). IFNR(-/-) mice have been shown to be susceptible to infection with ebolaviruses by multiple routes but it is not known if this murine model is suitable for testing therapeutics that rely on the generation of an immune response for efficacy. We have tested recombinant adenovirus vectors for their ability to protect IFNR(-/-) mice from challenge with Ebola virus and have analysed the humoral response generated after immunisation. The recombinant vaccines elicited good levels of protection in the knock-out mouse and the antibody response in IFNR(-/-) mice was similar to that observed in vaccinated wild-type mice. These results indicate that the IFNR(-/-) mouse is a relevant small animal model for studying ebolavirus-specific therapeutics.

24462697|t|Post-exposure efficacy of oral T-705 (Favipiravir) against inhalational Ebola virus infection in a mouse model.
24462697|a|Filoviruses cause disease with high case fatality rates and are considered biological threat agents. Licensed post-exposure therapies that can be administered by the oral route are desired for safe and rapid distribution and uptake in the event of exposure or outbreaks. Favipiravir or T-705 has broad antiviral activity and has already undergone phase II and is undergoing phase III clinical trials for influenza. Here we report the first use of T-705 against Ebola virus. T-705 gave 100% protection against aerosol Ebola virus E718 infection; protection was shown in immune-deficient mice after 14 days of twice-daily dosing. T-705 was also shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection in cell culture. T-705 is likely to be licensed for use against influenza in the near future and could also be used with a new indication for filovirus infection.

24473128|t|Comprehensive functional analysis of N-linked glycans on Ebola virus GP1.
24473128|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires the virion surface-associated glycoprotein (GP) that is composed of a trimer of heterodimers (GP1/GP2). The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N- and O-linked glycans. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)-dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency. IMPORTANCE: Filovirus outbreaks occur sporadically throughout central Africa, causing high fatality rates among the general public and health care workers. These unpredictable hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are caused by multiple species of Ebola viruses, as well as Marburg virus. While filovirus vaccines and therapeutics are being developed, there are no licensed products. The sole viral envelope glycoprotein, which is a principal immunogenic target, contains a heavy shield of glycans surrounding the conserved receptor-binding domain. We find that disruption of this shield through targeted mutagenesis leads to an increase in cell entry, protease sensitivity, and antiserum/antibody sensitivity but is not sufficient to allow virion binding to the intracellular receptor NPC1. Therefore, our studies provide evidence that filoviruses maintain glycoprotein glycosylation to protect against proteases and antibody neutralization at the expense of efficient entry. Our results unveil interesting insights into the unique entry process of filoviruses and potential immune evasion tactics of the virus.

25426834|t|Chimpanzee Adenovirus Vector Ebola Vaccine.
25426834|a|BACKGROUND: The unprecedented 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) prompted an international response to accelerate the availability of a preventive vaccine. A replication-defective recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 3-vectored ebolavirus vaccine (cAd3-EBO), encoding the glycoprotein from Zaire and Sudan species, that offers protection in the nonhuman primate model, was rapidly advanced into phase 1 clinical evaluation. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of cAd3-EBO. Twenty healthy adults, in sequentially enrolled groups of 10 each, received vaccination intramuscularly in doses of 2x10(10) particle units or 2x10(11) particle units. Primary and secondary end points related to safety and immunogenicity were assessed throughout the first 8 weeks after vaccination; in addition, longer-term vaccine durability was assessed at 48 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: In this small study, no safety concerns were identified; however, transient fever developed within 1 day after vaccination in two participants who had received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose. Glycoprotein-specific antibodies were induced in all 20 participants; the titers were of greater magnitude in the group that received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose than in the group that received the 2x10(10) particle-unit dose (geometric mean titer against the Zaire antigen at week 4, 2037 vs. 331; P=0.001). Glycoprotein-specific T-cell responses were more frequent among those who received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose than among those who received the 2x10(10) particle-unit dose, with a CD4 response in 10 of 10 participants versus 3 of 10 participants (P=0.004) and a CD8 response in 7 of 10 participants versus 2 of 10 participants (P=0.07) at week 4. Assessment of the durability of the antibody response showed that titers remained high at week 48, with the highest titers in those who received the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose. CONCLUSIONS: Reactogenicity and immune responses to cAd3-EBO vaccine were dose-dependent. At the 2x10(11) particle-unit dose, glycoprotein Zaire-specific antibody responses were in the range reported to be associated with vaccine-induced protective immunity in challenge studies involving nonhuman primates, and responses were sustained to week 48. Phase 2 studies and efficacy trials assessing cAd3-EBO are in progress.

25445348|t|Genome-wide analysis of codon usage bias in Ebolavirus.
25445348|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of the family Filoviridae and its genome consists of a 19-kb, single-stranded, negative sense RNA. EBOV is subdivided into five distinct species with different pathogenicities, being Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) the most lethal species. The interplay of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is expected to affect overall viral survival, fitness, evasion from host's immune system and evolution. In the present study, we performed comprehensive analyses of codon usage and composition of ZEBOV. Effective number of codons (ENC) indicates that the overall codon usage among ZEBOV strains is slightly biased. Different codon preferences in ZEBOV genes in relation to codon usage of human genes were found. Highly preferred codons are all A-ending triplets, which strongly suggests that mutational bias is a main force shaping codon usage in ZEBOV. Dinucleotide composition also plays a role in the overall pattern of ZEBOV codon usage. ZEBOV does not seem to use the most abundant tRNAs present in the human cells for most of their preferred codons.

25457751|t|Ebola virus convalescent blood products: where we are now and where we may need to go.
25457751|a|The world is regularly exposed to emerging infections with the potential to burst into a pandemic. One possible way to treat patients, when no other treatment is yet developed,is passive immunization performed by transfusing blood, plasma or plasma immunoglobul infractions obtained from convalescent donors who have recovered from the disease and have developed protective antibodies. The most recent on-going epidemic is caused by the Ebola virus, a filovirus responsible for Ebola virus disease, a severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever. Recently, the use of convalescent blood products was proposed by the WHO as one early option for treating patients with Ebola virus disease. This publication provides an overview of the various convalescent blood products and technological options that could theoretically be considered when there is a need to rely on this therapeutic approach.In countries without access to advanced blood-processing technologies, the choice may initially be restricted to convalescent whole blood or plasma. In technologically advanced countries, additional options for convalescent blood products are available, including virally inactivated plasma and fractionated immunoglobulins. The preparation of minipool immunoglobulins is also a realistic option to consider.

25473056|t|GB virus C coinfections in west African Ebola patients.
25473056|a|In 49 patients with known Ebola virus disease outcomes during the ongoing outbreak in Sierra Leone, 13 were coinfected with the immunomodulatory pegivirus GB virus C (GBV-C). Fifty-three percent of these GBV-C(+) patients survived; in contrast, only 22% of GBV-C(-) patients survived. Both survival and GBV-C status were associated with age, with older patients having lower survival rates and intermediate-age patients (21 to 45 years) having the highest rate of GBV-C infection. Understanding the separate and combined effects of GBV-C and age on Ebola virus survival may lead to new treatment and prevention strategies, perhaps through age-related pathways of immune activation.

25473261|t|What we know about ocular manifestations of Ebola.
25473261|a|Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a deadly disease caused by several species of ebolavirus. The current outbreak of 2014 is unique in that it has affected a greater number of people than ever before. It also has an unusual geographic distribution. Nonspecific findings such as fever and generalized weakness have traditionally been very common early in the acute phase. Ophthalmic manifestations have also been reported in significant numbers. Conjunctival injection has been identified in both the acute and late phases. Subconjunctival hemorrhage and excessive lacrimation have also been reported. Various forms of uveitis have been associated with the convalescent phase of the disease. When identified in conjunction with other signs such as fever, acute findings such as conjunctivitis may contribute to the diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Ideally, serologic testing should be performed prior to isolation and treatment of these individuals. Considering the prevalence of the current outbreak and the threat of transcontinental spread, ophthalmic health professionals need to be aware of the ocular manifestations of Ebola hemorrhagic fever as well as the associated signs and symptoms in order to prevent further spread.

25481284|t|Controlled viral glycoprotein expression as a safety feature in a bivalent rabies-ebola vaccine.
25481284|a|Using a recombinant rabies (RABV) vaccine platform, we have developed several safe and effective vaccines. Most recently, we have developed a RABV-based ebolavirus (EBOV) vaccine that is efficacious in nonhuman primates. One safety feature of this vaccine is the utilization of a live but replication-deficient RABV construct. In this construct, the RABV glycoprotein (G) has been deleted from the genome, requiring G trans complementation in order for new infectious viruses to be released from the initial infected cell. Here we analyze this safety feature of the bivalent RABV-based EBOV vaccine comprised of the G-deleted RABV backbone expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP). We found that, while the level of RABV genome in infected cells is equivalent regardless of G supplementation, the production of infectious virus is indeed restricted by the lack of G, and most importantly, that the presence of EBOV GP does not substitute for G. These findings further support the safety profile of this replication-deficient RABV-EBOV bivalent vaccine.

25481298|t|Ebola virus (EBOV) infection: Therapeutic strategies.
25481298|a|Within less than a year after its epidemic started (in December 2013) in Guinea, Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the filoviridae, has spread over a number of West-African countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia) and gained allures that have been unprecedented except by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although EBOV is highly contagious and transmitted by direct contact with body fluids, it could be counteracted by the adequate chemoprophylactic and -therapeutic interventions: vaccines, antibodies, siRNAs (small interfering RNAs), interferons and chemical substances, i.e. neplanocin A derivatives (i.e. 3-deazaneplanocin A), BCX4430, favipiravir (T-705), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and a variety of compounds that have been found to inhibit EBOV infection blocking viral entry or by a mode of action that still has to be resolved. Much has to be learned from the mechanism of action of the compounds active against VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), a virus belonging to the rhabdoviridae, that in its mode of replication could be exemplary for the replication of filoviridae.

25493109|t|Ebola Virus Disease: essential public health principles for clinicians.
25493109|a|Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) has become a public health emergency of international concern. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed guidance to educate and inform healthcare workers and travelers worldwide. Symptoms of EVD include abrupt onset of fever, myalgias, and headache in the early phase, followed by vomiting, diarrhea and possible progression to hemorrhagic rash, life-threatening bleeding, and multi-organ failure in the later phase. The disease is not transmitted via airborne spread like influenza, but rather from person-to-person, or animal to person, via direct contact with bodily fluids or blood. It is crucial that emergency physicians be educated on disease presentation and how to generate a timely and accurate differential diagnosis that includes exotic diseases in the appropriate patient population. A patient should be evaluated for EVD when both suggestive symptoms, including unexplained hemorrhage, AND risk factors within 3 weeks prior, such as travel to an endemic area, direct handling of animals from outbreak areas, or ingestion of fruit or other uncooked foods contaminated with bat feces containing the virus are present. There are experimental therapies for treatment of EVD virus; however the mainstay of therapy is supportive care. Emergency department personnel on the frontlines must be prepared to rapidly identify and isolate febrile travelers if indicated. All healthcare workers involved in care of EVD patients should wear personal protective equipment. Despite the intense media focus on EVD rather than other threats, emergency physicians must master and follow essential public health principles for management of all infectious diseases. This includes not only identification and treatment of individuals, but also protection of healthcare workers and prevention of spread, keeping in mind the possibility of other more common disease processes.

25494457|t|VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP-induced innate protection enhances natural killer cell activity to increase survival in a lethal mouse adapted Ebola virus infection.
25494457|a|Members of the species Zaire ebolavirus cause severe hemorrhagic fever with up to a 90% mortality rate in humans. The VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP vaccine has provided 100% protection in the mouse, guinea pig, and nonhuman primate (NHP) models, and has also been utilized as a post-exposure therapeutic to protect mice, guinea pigs, and NHPs from a lethal challenge of Ebola virus (EBOV). EBOV infection causes rapid mortality in human and animal models, with death occurring as early as 6 days after infection, suggesting a vital role for the innate immune system to control the infection before cells of the adaptive immune system can assume control. Natural killer (NK) cells are the predominant cell of the innate immune response, which has been shown to expand with VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP treatment. In the current study, an in vivo mouse model of the VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP post-exposure treatment was used for a mouse adapted (MA)-EBOV infection, to determine the putative VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP-induced protective mechanism of NK cells. NK depletion studies demonstrated that mice with NK cells survive longer in a MA-EBOV infection, which is further enhanced with VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP treatment. NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion was significantly higher with VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP treatment. Cell mediated cytotoxicity assays and perforin knockout mice experiments suggest that there are perforin-dependent and -independent mechanisms involved. Together, these data suggest that NK cells play an important role in VSVDeltaG/EBOV GP-induced protection of EBOV by increasing NK cytotoxicity, and IFN-gamma secretion.

25495064|t|Quantifying the epidemic spread of Ebola virus (EBOV) in Sierra Leone using phylodynamics.
25495064|a|Measuring epidemic parameters early in an outbreak is essential to inform control efforts. Using the viral genome sequence and collection date from 78 infections in the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Sierra Leone, we estimate key epidemiological parameters such as infectious period duration (approximately 71 hours) and date of the first case in Sierra Leone (approximately April 25th). We also estimate the effective reproduction number, Re, (approximately 1.26), which is the number of secondary infections effectively caused by an infected individual and accounts for public health control measures. This study illustrates that phylodynamics methods, applied during the initial phase of an outbreak on fewer and more easily attainable data, can yield similar estimates to count-based epidemiological studies.

25496121|t|What is Ebola?
25496121|a|On 23 March 2014, the World Health Organization first announced a new Ebola virus outbreak that started in December 2013 in the eastern part of the Republic of Guinea. Human infections shortly emerged in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. On 30 September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed through laboratory testing the first Ebola virus infection diagnosed in the USA, in a patient who travelled from West Africa to Texas. On 6 October 2014, the first human infection occurring outside of Africa was reported, in a Spanish nurse who treated two priests, both of whom died, and on 23 October 2014, the first human infection was reported in New York City. To date, the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak is the longest, largest, and most persistent one since 1976, when the virus was first identified in humans, and the number of human cases exceeded, as of mid-September 2014, the cumulative number of infections from all the previous outbreaks. The early clinical presentation overlaps with other infectious diseases, opening differential diagnosis difficulties. Understanding the transmission routes and identifying the natural reservoir of the virus are additional challenges in studying Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Ebola virus is as much a public health challenge for developing countries as it is for the developed world, and previous outbreaks underscored that the relative contribution of the risk factors may differ among outbreaks. The implementation of effective preparedness plans is contingent on integrating teachings from previous Ebola virus outbreaks with those from the current outbreak and with lessons provided by other infectious diseases, along with developing a multifaceted inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary framework that should be established and shaped by biomedical as well as sociopolitical sciences.

25501666|t|Ebola virus as a sexually transmitted infection.
25501666|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ongoing Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa is a major global health challenge. The main mode of transmission is through contact with bodily fluids and skin of those infected or who have died. This review was undertaken to consider the evidence for transmission by contact with bodily fluids occurring through sexual activity. RECENT FINDINGS: No cases in the previous 20 outbreaks or the current outbreak in West Africa have been shown to be sexually transmitted, although other types of viral haemorrhagic fever have had sexual transmission implicated. Ebola virus is found in sites and fluids associated with sexual activity but this occurs at different stages of the disease. Persistence in the convalescent period occurs in rectum, vagina and semen, with persistence in semen being longest of up to at least 101 days. Recommendations based on this data are that those recovering from Ebola virus disease should abstain from all sexual intercourse, or if this is not possible, use condoms, for 3 months after the onset of symptoms. SUMMARY: There is theoretical plausibility for sexual transmission of Ebola virus but there has been no evidence of this occurring. Further research is needed to consider if sexual activity contributes to the epidemic in order to inform individuals with regard to avoiding acquisition or transmission by those recovering from Ebola virus disease.

25512227|t|Could pharmacological curtailment of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway reverse the endothelial barrier dysfunction associated with Ebola virus infection?
25512227|a|Activation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway induces endothelial barrier dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, which is a hallmark of various life-threatening vascular pathologies. Therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK pathway have proven effective in the attenuation of vascular leakage observed in animal models of endotoxin-induced lung injury/sepsis, edema, autoimmune disorders, and stroke. These findings suggest that treatments targeting the ROCK pathway might be of benefit in the management of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), which is characterized by severe vascular leak, likely involving pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, released from virus-infected macrophages. In this paper, we review evidence from in vivo and in vitro models of vascular leakage, suggesting that the RhoA/ROCK pathway is an important therapeutic target for the reversal of the vascular permeability defects associated with EVD. Future studies should explore the efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of RhoA/ROCK pathway on reversing the endothelial barrier dysfunction in animal models of EVD and other hemorrhagic fever virus infections as part of an adjunctive therapy. Such experimental studies should focus, in particular, on the small molecule fasudil (HA-1077), a derivative of isoquinoline, which is a safe and clinically approved inhibitor of ROCK, making it an excellent candidate in this context.

25514385|t|Characterization of clinical and immunological parameters during Ebola virus infection of rhesus macaques.
25514385|a|The rhesus macaque serves as an animal model for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. A thorough understanding of EBOV infection in this species would aid in further development of filovirus therapeutics and vaccines. In this study, pathological and immunological data from EBOV-infected rhesus macaques are presented. Changes in blood chemistries, hematology, coagulation, and immune parameters during infection, which were consistently observed in the animals, are presented. In an animal that survived challenge, a delay was observed in the detection of viral RNA and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which may have contributed to survival. Collectively, these data add to the body of knowledge regarding EBOV pathogenesis in rhesus macaques and emphasize the reproducibility of the rhesus macaque challenge model.

25522088|t|Update: ebola virus disease epidemic - West Africa, December 2014.
25522088|a|CDC is assisting ministries of health and working with other organizations to end the ongoing epidemic of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa. The updated data in this report were compiled from situation reports from the Guinea Interministerial Committee for Response Against the Ebola Virus, the World Health Organization, the Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Total case counts include all suspected, probable, and confirmed cases, which are defined similarly by each country. These data reflect reported cases, which make up an unknown proportion of all cases, and reporting delays that vary from country to country.

25522089|t|Challenges in responding to the ebola epidemic - four rural counties, Liberia, August-November 2014.
25522089|a|The first cases of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa were identified in Guinea on March 22, 2014. On March 30, the first Liberian case was identified in Foya Town, Lofa County, near the Guinean border. Because the majority of early cases occurred in Lofa and Montserrado counties, resources were concentrated in these counties during the first several months of the response, and these counties have seen signs of successful disease control. By October 2014, the epidemic had reached all 15 counties of Liberia. During August 27-September 10, 2014, CDC in collaboration with the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare assessed county Ebola response plans in four rural counties (Grand Cape Mount, Grand Bassa, Rivercess, and Sinoe, to identify county-specific challenges in executing their Ebola response plans, and to provide recommendations and training to enhance control efforts. Assessments were conducted through interviews with county health teams and health care providers and visits to health care facilities. At the time of assessment, county health teams reported lacking adequate training in core Ebola response strategies and reported facing many challenges because of poor transportation and communication networks. Development of communication and transportation network strategies for communities with limited access to roads and limited means of communication in addition to adequate training in Ebola response strategies is critical for successful management of Ebola in remote areas.

25522340|t|Ebola in children: epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis and outcomes.
25522340|a|Ebola virus disease is caused by a highly contagious and pathogenic threadlike RNA virus of the Filoviridae family. The index human case is usually a zoonosis that launches human-to-human transmission interface with varying levels of sustainability of the epidemic depending on the level of public health preparedness of the affected country and the Ebola virus strain. The disease affects all age groups in the population. Clinical diagnosis is challenging in index cases especially in the early stages of the disease when the presenting features are usually nonspecific and only similar to a flu-like illness. However, in the agonal stages, hemorrhage frequently occurs in a high proportion of cases. The diagnostic gold standard is by detecting the antigen using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates in the past 28 outbreaks since 1976 have ranged from 30% to 100% in different settings among adults, but lower mortality rates have been documented in children. This review aims to describe Ebola virus infection, clinical presentation, diagnosis and outcomes in children.

25523781|t|Complete genome sequences of three ebola virus isolates from the 2014 outbreak in west Africa.
25523781|a|Here, we report the complete genome sequences, including the genome termini, of three Ebola virus isolates (species Zaire ebolavirus) originating from Guinea that are now being widely used in laboratories in North America for research regarding West African Ebola viruses.

25530596|t|Physicians' obligations to patients infected with Ebola: echoes of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
25530596|a|Physicians across the United States are engaged in training in the identification, isolation, and initial care of patients with Ebola. Some will be asked to do more. The issue this viewpoint will address is the moral obligation of physicians to participate in these activities. In order to do so the implicit contract between society and its physicians will be considered, as will many of the arguments that are redolent of those that were litigated 30 years ago when acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was raising public fears to similar levels, and some physicians were publically proclaiming their unwillingness to render care to those individuals. We will build the case that if steps are taken to reduce risks-optimal personal protective equipment and training-to what is essentially the lowest possible level then rendering care should be seen as obligatory. If not, as in the AIDS era there will be an unfair distribution of risk, with those who take their obligations seriously having to go beyond their fair measure of exposure. It would also potentially undermine patients' faith in the altruism of physicians and thereby degrade the esteem in which our profession is held and the trust that underpins the therapeutic relationship. Finally there is an implicit contract with society. Society gives tremendously to us; we encumber a debt from all society does and offers, a debt for which recompense is rarely sought. The mosaic of moral, historical, and professional imperatives to render care to the infected all echoes the words of medicine's moral leaders in the AIDS epidemic. Arnold Relman perhaps put it most succinctly, "the risk of contracting the patient's disease is one of the risks that is inherent in the profession of medicine. Physicians who are not willing to accept that risk...ought not be in the practice of medicine."

25531344|t|Multiple circulating infections can mimic the early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers and possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the 2014 outbreak.
25531344|a|Lassa fever (LF) is a severe viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV). The LF program at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in Eastern Sierra Leone currently provides diagnostic services and clinical care for more than 500 suspected LF cases per year. Nearly two-thirds of suspected LF patients presenting to the LF Ward test negative for either LASV antigen or anti-LASV immunoglobulin M (IgM), and therefore are considered to have a non-Lassa febrile illness (NLFI). The NLFI patients in this study were generally severely ill, which accounts for their high case fatality rate of 36%. The current studies were aimed at determining possible causes of severe febrile illnesses in non-LF cases presenting to the KGH, including possible involvement of filoviruses. A seroprevalence survey employing commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests revealed significant IgM and IgG reactivity against dengue virus, chikungunya virus, West Nile virus (WNV), Leptospira, and typhus. A polymerase chain reaction-based survey using sera from subjects with acute LF, evidence of prior LASV exposure, or NLFI revealed widespread infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. WNV RNA was detected in a subset of patients, and a 419 nt amplicon specific to filoviral L segment RNA was detected at low levels in a single patient. However, 22% of the patients presenting at the KGH between 2011 and 2014 who were included in this survey registered anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) IgG or IgM, suggesting prior exposure to this agent. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is already the deadliest and most widely dispersed outbreak of its kind on record. Serological evidence reported here for possible human exposure to filoviruses in Sierra Leone prior to the current EVD outbreak supports genetic analysis that EBOV may have been present in West Africa for some time prior to the 2014 outbreak.

25532798|t|Small molecule inhibitors of ebola virus infection.
25532798|a|Ebola viruses are extremely virulent and highly transmissible. They are responsible for sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fevers with human mortality rates of up to 90%. No prophylactic or therapeutic treatments in the form of vaccine, biologicals or small molecule, currently exist. Yet, a wealth of antiviral research on ebola virus is being generated and potential inhibitors have been identified in biological screening and medicinal chemistry programs. Here, we detail the state-of-the-art in small molecule inhibitors of ebola virus infection, with >60 examples, including approved drugs, compounds currently in clinical trials, and more exploratory leads, and summarize the associated in vitro and in vivo evidence for their effectiveness.

25534190|t|Severe Ebola virus disease with vascular leakage and multiorgan failure: treatment of a patient in intensive care.
25534190|a|BACKGROUND: In the current epidemic of Ebola virus disease in western Africa, many aid workers have become infected. Some of these aid workers have been transferred to specialised hospitals in Europe and the USA for intensified treatment, providing the potential for unique insight into the clinical course of Ebola virus disease under optimised supportive measures in isolation units. METHODS: A 38-year-old male doctor who had contracted an Ebola virus infection in Sierra Leone was airlifted to University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, on day 5 after disease onset. Within 72 h of admission to the hospital's high-level isolation unit, the patient developed signs of severe multiorgan failure, including lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In addition to clinical parameters, the diagnostic work-up included radiography, ultrasound, pulse contour cardiac output technology, and microbiological and clinical chemistry analyses. Respiratory failure with pulmonary oedema and biophysical evidence of vascular leak syndrome needed mechanical ventilation. The patient received a 3 day treatment course with FX06 (MChE-F4Pharma, Vienna, Austria), a fibrin-derived peptide under clinical development for vascular leak syndrome. After FX06 administration and concurrent detection of Ebola-virus-specific antibodies and a fall in viral load, vascular leak syndrome and respiratory parameters substantially improved. We gave broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy and the patient needed intermittent renal replacement therapy. The patient fully recovered. FINDINGS: This case report shows the feasibility of delivery of successful intensive care therapy to patients with Ebola virus disease under biosafety level 4 conditions. INTERPRETATION: The effective treatment of vascular leakage and multiorgan failure by combination of ventilatory support, antibiotic treatment, and renal replacement therapy can sustain a patient with severe Ebola virus disease until virological remission. FX06 could potentially be a valuable agent in contribution to supportive therapy. FUNDING: University Hospital of Frankfurt.

25535021|t|A race for an Ebola vaccine: promises and obstacles.
25535021|a|While several impeding factors have limited Ebola vaccine development, the current epidemic has provided a surge which may lead to a record pace for a vaccine against Ebola. Consequently, multiple FDA trials are currently underway using two promising vaccine platforms; one has recently demonstrated durable immunity within non-human primates.

25540891|t|Safety and immunogenicity of Ebola virus and Marburg virus glycoprotein DNA vaccines assessed separately and concomitantly in healthy Ugandan adults: a phase 1b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
25540891|a|BACKGROUND: Ebola virus and Marburg virus cause serious disease outbreaks with high case fatality rates. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two investigational DNA vaccines, one (EBO vaccine) encoding Ebola virus Zaire and Sudan glycoproteins and one (MAR) encoding Marburg virus glycoprotein. METHODS: RV 247 was a phase 1b, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Kampala, Uganda to examine the safety and immunogenicity of the EBO and MAR vaccines given individually and concomitantly. Healthy adult volunteers aged 18-50 years were randomly assigned (5:1) to receive three injections of vaccine or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with vaccine allocations divided equally between three active vaccine groups: EBO vaccine only, MAR vaccine only, and both vaccines. The primary study objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the vaccines, as assessed by local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. We also assessed immunogenicity on the basis of antibody responses (ELISA) and T-cell responses (ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining assays) 4 weeks after the third injection. Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00997607. FINDINGS: 108 participants were enrolled into the study between Nov 2, 2009, and April 15, 2010. All 108 participants received at least one study injection (including 100 who completed the injection schedule) and were included in safety and tolerability analyses; 107 for whom data were available were included in the immunogenicity analyses. Study injections were well tolerated, with no significant differences in local or systemic reactions between groups. The vaccines elicited antibody and T-cell responses specific to the glycoproteins received and we detected no differences between the separate and concomitant use of the two vaccines. 17 of 30 (57%, 95% CI 37-75) participants in the EBO vaccine group had an antibody response to the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein, as did 14 of 30 (47%, 28-66) in the group that received both vaccines. 15 of 30 (50%, 31-69) participants in the EBO vaccine group had an antibody response to the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein, as did 15 of 30 (50%, 31-69) in the group that received both vaccines. Nine of 29 (31%, 15-51) participants in the MAR vaccine groups had an antibody response to the Marburg glycoprotein, as did seven of 30 (23%, 10-42) in the group that received both vaccines. 19 of 30 (63%, 44-80) participants in the EBO vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein, as did 10 of 30 (33%, 17-53) in the group that received both vaccines. 13 of 30 (43%, 25-63) participants in the EBO vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein, as did 10 of 30 (33%, 17-53) in the group that received both vaccines. 15 of 29 (52%, 33-71) participants in the MAR vaccine group had a T-cell response to the Marburg glycoprotein, as did 13 of 30 (43%, 25-63) in the group that received both vaccines. INTERPRETATION: This study is the first Ebola or Marburg vaccine trial done in Africa, and the results show that, given separately or together, both vaccines were well tolerated and elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. These findings have contributed to the accelerated development of more potent Ebola virus vaccines that encode the same wild-type glycoprotein antigens as the EBO vaccine, which are being assessed during the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak in west Africa.

25544306|t|Favipiravir: a new medication for the Ebola virus disease pandemic.
25544306|a|The purpose of this report is to advocate speedy approval and less stringent regulations for the use of experimental drugs such as favipiravir in emergencies. Favipiravir is a new antiviral medication that can be used in emerging viral pandemics such as Ebola virus, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, Lassa fever, and Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Although favipiravir is one of the choices for the treatment of patients with Ebola virus, several concerns exist. First, a clinical trial of favipiravir in patients infected with the Ebola virus has not yet been conducted, and further studies are required. Second, favipiravir has a risk for teratogenicity and embryotoxicity. Therefore, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan has approved this medication with strict regulations for its production and clinical use. However, owing to the emerging Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, on August 15, 2014, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan approved the use of favipiravir, if needed.

25547682|t|Nucleoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (indirect ELISA) for detecting antibodies specific to Ebola virus and Marbug virus.
25547682|a|Full-length nucleoproteins from Ebola and Marburg viruses were expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and nucleoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were established for the detection of antibodies specific to Ebola and Marburg viruses. The ELISAs were evaluated by testing antisera collected from rabbit immunized with Ebola and Marburg virus nucleoproteins. Although little cross-reactivity of antibodies was observed in anti-Ebola virus nucleoprotein rabbit antisera, the highest reactions to immunoglobulin G (IgG) were uniformly detected against the nucleoprotein antigens of homologous viruses. We further evaluated the ELISA's ability to detect antibodies to Ebola and Marburg viruses using human sera samples collected from individuals passing through the Guangdong port of entry. With a threshold set at the mean plus three standard deviations of average optical densities of sera tested, the ELISA systems using these two recombinant nucleoproteins have good sensitivity and specificity. These results demonstrate the usefulness of ELISA for diagnostics as well as ecological and serosurvey studies of Ebola and Marburg virus infection.

25552710|t|Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus display late cell entry kinetics: evidence that transport to NPC1+ endolysosomes is a rate-defining step.
25552710|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) causes hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality rates. During cellular entry, the virus is internalized by macropinocytosis and trafficked through endosomes until fusion between the viral and an endosomal membrane is triggered, releasing the RNA genome into the cytoplasm. We found that while macropinocytotic uptake of filamentous EBOV viruslike particles (VLPs) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) occurs relatively quickly, VLPs only begin to enter the cytoplasm after a 30-min lag, considerably later than particles bearing the influenza hemagglutinin or GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which enter through late endosomes (LE). For EBOV, the long lag is not due to the large size or unusual shape of EBOV filaments, the need to prime EBOV GP to the 19-kDa receptor-binding species, or a need for unusually low endosomal pH. In contrast, since we observed that EBOV entry occurs upon arrival in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive endolysosomes (LE/Lys), we propose that trafficking to LE/Lys is a key rate-defining step. Additional experiments revealed, unexpectedly, that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) S-mediated entry also begins only after a 30-min lag. Furthermore, although SARS does not require NPC1 for entry, SARS entry also begins after colocalization with NPC1. Since the only endosomal requirement for SARS entry is cathepsin L activity, we tested and provide evidence that NPC1(+) LE/Lys have higher cathepsin L activity than LE, with no detectable activity in earlier endosomes. Our findings suggest that both EBOV and SARS traffic deep into the endocytic pathway for entry and that they do so to access higher cathepsin activity. IMPORTANCE: Ebola virus is a hemorrhagic fever virus that causes high fatality rates when it spreads from zoonotic vectors into the human population. Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes severe respiratory distress in infected patients. A devastating outbreak of EBOV occurred in West Africa in 2014, and there was a significant outbreak of SARS in 2003. No effective vaccine or treatment has yet been approved for either virus. We present evidence that both viruses traffic late into the endocytic pathway, to NPC1(+) LE/Lys, in order to enter host cells, and that they do so to access high levels of cathepsin activity, which both viruses use in their fusion-triggering mechanisms. This unexpected similarity suggests an unexplored vulnerability, trafficking to NPC1(+) LE/Lys, as a therapeutic target for SARS and EBOV.

25565430|t|Ebola outbreak in rural West Africa: epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes.
25565430|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe Ebola cases in the district Ebola management centre of in Kailahun, a remote rural district of Sierra Leone, in terms of geographic origin, patient and hospitalisation characteristics, treatment outcomes and time from symptom onset to admission. METHODS: Data of all Ebola cases from June 23rd to October 5th 2014 were reviewed. Ebola was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Of 489 confirmed cases (51% male, median age 28 years), 166 (34%) originated outside Kailahun district. Twenty-eight (6%) were health workers: 2 doctors, 11 nurses, 2 laboratory technicians, 7 community health workers and 6 other cadres. More than 50% of patients had fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea/vomiting. An unusual feature was cough in 40%. Unexplained bleeding was reported in 5%. Outcomes for the 489 confirmed cases were 227 (47%) discharges, 259 (53%) deaths and 3 transfers. Case fatality in health workers (68%) was higher than other occupations (52%, P = 0.05). The median community infectivity time was 6.5 days for both general population and health workers (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: One in three admitted cases originated outside Kailahun district due to limited national access to Ebola management centres - complicating contact tracing, safe burial and disinfection measures. The comparatively high case fatality among health workers requires attention. The community infectivity time needs to be reduced to prevent continued transmission.

25566687|t|Theoretical perspectives on the infectiousness of Ebola virus disease.
25566687|a|BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) has generated a large epidemic in West Africa since December 2013. This mini-review is aimed to clarify and illustrate different theoretical concepts of infectiousness in order to compare the infectiousness across different communicable diseases including EVD. METHODS: We employed a transmission model that rests on the renewal process in order to clarify theoretical concepts on infectiousness, namely the basic reproduction number, R0, which measures the infectiousness per generation of cases, the force of infection (i.e. the hazard rate of infection), the intrinsic growth rate (i.e. infectiousness per unit time) and the per-contact probability of infection (i.e. infectiousness per effective contact). RESULTS: Whereas R0 of EVD is similar to that of influenza, the growth rate (i.e. the measure of infectiousness per unit time) for EVD was shown to be comparatively lower than that for influenza. Moreover, EVD and influenza differ in mode of transmission whereby the probability of transmission per contact is lower for EVD compared to that of influenza. CONCLUSIONS: The slow spread of EVD associated with the need for physical contact with body fluids supports social distancing measures including contact tracing and case isolation. Descriptions and interpretations of different variables quantifying infectiousness need to be used clearly and objectively in the scientific community and for risk communication.

36273490|a|BACKGROUND: Children account for a substantial proportion of cases and deaths during Ebola virus disease outbreaks. We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine in children who had been vaccinated with a two-dose regimen comprising Ad26.ZEBOV as dose one and MVA-BN-Filo as dose two. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial at one clinic in Kambia Town, Sierra Leone. Healthy children, excluding pregnant or breastfeeding girls, who had received the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen in a previous study, and were aged 1-11 years at the time of their first vaccine dose, received an intramuscular injection of Ad26.ZEBOV (5 x 10(10) viral particles) and were followed up for 28 days. Primary outcomes were safety (measured by adverse events) and immunogenicity (measured by Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific IgG binding antibody geometric mean concentration) of the booster vaccine dose. Safety was assessed in all participants who received the booster vaccination; immunogenicity was assessed in all participants who received the booster vaccination, had at least one evaluable sample after the booster, and had no major protocol deviations that could have influenced the immune response. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04711356. FINDINGS: Between July 8 and Aug 18, 2021, 58 children were assessed for eligibility and 50 (27 aged 4-7 years and 23 aged 9-15 years) were enrolled and received an Ad26.ZEBOV booster vaccination, more than 3 years after receiving dose one of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen. The booster was well tolerated. The most common solicited local adverse event during the 7 days after vaccination was injection site pain, reported in 18 (36%, 95% CI 23-51) of 50 participants. The most common solicited systemic adverse event during the 7 days after vaccination was headache, reported in 11 (22%, 12-36) of 50 participants. Malaria was the most common unsolicited adverse event during the 28 days after vaccination, reported in 25 (50%, 36-64) of 50 participants. No serious adverse events were observed during the study period. 7 days after vaccination, the Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific IgG binding antibody geometric mean concentration was 28 561 ELISA units per mL (95% CI 20 255-40 272), which was 44 times higher than the geometric mean concentration before the booster dose. 21 days after vaccination, the geometric mean concentration reached 64 690 ELISA units per mL (95% CI 48 356-86 541), which was 101 times higher than the geometric mean concentration before the booster dose. INTERPRETATION: A booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV in children who had received the two-dose Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen more than 3 years earlier was well tolerated and induced a rapid and robust increase in binding antibodies against Ebola virus. These findings could inform Ebola vaccination strategies in paediatric populations. FUNDING: Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking.

36279832|t|Instruction of molecular structure similarity and scaffolds of drugs under investigation in ebola virus treatment by atom-pair and graph network: A combination of favipiravir and molnupiravir.
36279832|a|The virus that causes Ebola is fatal. Although many researchers have attempted to contain this deadly infection, the fatality rate remains high. The atom-pair fingerprint technique was used to compare drugs suggested for the treatment of Ebola or those that are currently being tested in clinical settings. Subsequently, using scaffold network graph (SNG) methods, the molecular and structural scaffolds of the drugs chosen based on these similar results were created, and the drug structures were examined. Public databases (PubChem and DrugBank) and literature regarding Ebola treatment were used in the analysis. Graphical representations of the molecular architecture and core structures of the drugs with the highest similarity to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs were produced using the SNG method. The combination of molnupiravir, the first licensed oral medication candidate for COVID-19, and favipiravir, employed in other viral outbreaks, should be further researched for treating Ebola, as observed in our study. We also believe that chemists will benefit from understanding the core structure(s) of medication molecules effective against the Ebola virus, their inhibitors, and the chemical structure similarities of existing pharmaceuticals utilized to build alternative drugs or drug combinations.

36303436|t|Self-amplifying RNA vaccine protects mice against lethal Ebola virus infection.
36303436|a|Emerging and re-emerging viruses, such as Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV), pose a global threat and require immediate countermeasures, including the rapid development of effective vaccines that are easy to manufacture. Synthetic self-amplifying RNAs (saRNAs) attend to these needs, being safe and strong immune stimulators that can be inexpensively produced in large quantities, using cell-free systems and good manufacturing practice. Here, the first goal was to develop and optimize an anti-EBOV saRNA-based vaccine in terms of its antigen composition and route of administration. Vaccinating mice with saRNAs expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) alone or in combination with the nucleoprotein (NP) elicited antigen-specific immune responses. GP-specific antibodies showed neutralizing activity against EBOV. Strong CD4(+) T cell response against NP and GP and CD8(+) T cell response against NP were detected by ELISpot assays. Intramuscular vaccination with saRNAs conferred better immune response than intradermal. Finally, mice vaccinated in a prime-boost regimen with saRNAs encoding both GP and NP or with GP alone survived an EBOV infection. In addition, a single dose of GP and NP saRNAs was also protective against fatal EBOV infection. Overall, saRNAs expressing viral antigens represent a promising vaccine platform.

36310868|t|Macrophage infection, activation, and histopathological findings in ebolavirus infection.
36310868|a|Macrophages contribute to Ebola virus disease through their susceptibility to direct infection, their multi-faceted response to ebolaviruses, and their association with pathological findings in tissues throughout the body. Viral attachment and entry factors, as well as the more recently described influence of cell polarization, shape macrophage susceptibility to direct infection. Moreover, the study of Toll-like receptor 4 and the RIG-I-like receptor pathway in the macrophage response to ebolaviruses highlight important immune signaling pathways contributing to the breadth of macrophage responses. Lastly, the deep histopathological catalogue of macrophage involvement across numerous tissues during infection has been enriched by descriptions of tissues involved in sequelae following acute infection, including: the eye, joints, and the nervous system. Building upon this knowledge base, future opportunities include characterization of macrophage phenotypes beneficial or deleterious to survival, delineation of the specific roles macrophages play in pathological lesion development in affected tissues, and the creation of macrophage-specific therapeutics enhancing the beneficial activities and reducing the deleterious contributions of macrophages to the outcome of Ebola virus disease.

36331778|t|Transcriptional induction of TGF-beta1 and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition cell markers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by Ebola virus infection.
36331778|a|BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a serious hemorrhagic disease in humans, with a mortality rate of up to 80%. Despite significant achievements in the past decades elucidating the pathogenesis of EBOV, there is still much to be elucidated about the cell type-specific host response and their functional roles during infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gain insight into cell type-specific host responses to EBOV infection. METHODS: Real-time RT-qPCR analysis was used to identify host transcriptional changes in epithelial Caco-2 cells and endothelial HUVECs by EBOV infection. RESULTS: EBOV efficiently infected to both Caco-2 cells and HUVECs, depending on the time of infection. However, changes in the transcriptional levels of several host cellular genes following viral infection showed significant differences between Caco-2 cells and HUVECs. EBOV infection increases the transcription of TGF-beta1, a key factor in epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT), only in HUVECs, but not in Caco-2 cells. This upregulation in turn induces the transcription of other EMT signaling molecules such as snail, slug and MMP9, ultimately leading to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Furthermore, this EndMT process appears to be associated with increased transcription of stem-cell markers such as Klf4, Sox2 and Oct4. However, most of these transcriptional changes due to EBOV infection did not occur in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that EMT or EndMT by EBOV infection is cell type-specific. CONCLUSION: We propose that EBOV infection induces the expression of TGF-beta1-mediated signals in endothelial HUVECs, resulting in EndMT. This could provide broader information to elucidate the pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease.

36352100|t|Persistent intraocular Ebola virus RNA is associated with severe uveitis in a convalescent rhesus monkey.
36352100|a|Despite increasing evidence that uveitis is common and consequential in survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD), the host-pathogen determinants of the clinical phenotype are undefined, including the pathogenetic role of persistent viral antigen, ocular tissue-specific immune responses, and histopathologic characterization. Absent sampling of human intraocular fluids and tissues, these questions might be investigated in animal models of disease; however, challenges intrinsic to the nonhuman primate model and the animal biosafety level 4 setting have historically limited inquiry. In a rhesus monkey survivor of experimental Ebola virus (EBOV) infection, we observed and documented the clinical, virologic, immunologic, and histopathologic features of severe uveitis. Here we show the clinical natural history, resultant ocular pathology, intraocular antigen-specific antibody detection, and persistent intraocular EBOV RNA detected long after clinical resolution.

36370717|t|Differential symptomology of possible and confirmed Ebola virus disease infection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a retrospective cohort study.
36370717|a|BACKGROUND: In its earliest phases, Ebola virus disease's rapid-onset, high fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms are largely indistinguishable from other infectious illnesses. We aimed to characterise the clinical indicators associated with Ebola virus disease to improve outbreak response. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we assessed routinely collected data from individuals with possible Ebola virus disease attending 30 Ebola health facilities in two provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between Aug 1, 2018, and Aug 28, 2019. We used logistic regression analysis to model the probability of Ebola infection across 34 clinical variables and four types of possible Ebola virus disease exposures: contact with an individual known to have Ebola virus disease, attendance at any funeral, health facility consultation, or consultation with an informal health practitioner. FINDINGS: Data for 24 666 individuals were included. If a patient presented to care in the early symptomatic phase (ie, days 0-2), Ebola virus disease positivity was most associated with previous exposure to an individual with Ebola virus disease (odds ratio [OR] 11.9, 95% CI 9.1-15.8), funeral attendance (2.1, 1.6-2.7), or health facility consultations (2.1, 1.6-2.8), rather than clinical parameters. If presentation occurred on day 3 or later (after symptom onset), bleeding at an injection site (OR 33.9, 95% CI 12.7-101.3), bleeding gums (7.5, 3.7-15.4), conjunctivitis (2.4, 1.7-3.4), asthenia (1.9, 1.5-2.3), sore throat (1.8, 1.3-2.4), dysphagia (1.8, 1.4-2.3), and diarrhoea (1.6, 1.3-1.9) were additional strong predictors of Ebola virus disease. Some Ebola virus disease-specific signs were less prevalent among vaccinated individuals who were positive for Ebola virus disease when compared with the unvaccinated, such as dysphagia (-47%, p=0.0024), haematemesis (-90%, p=0.0131), and bleeding gums (-100%, p=0.0035). INTERPRETATION: Establishing the exact time an individual first had symptoms is essential to assessing their infection risk. An individual's exposure history remains of paramount importance, especially in the early phase. Ebola virus disease vaccination reduces symptom severity and should also be considered when assessing the likelihood of infection. These findings about symptomatology should be translated into practice during triage and should inform testing and quarantine procedures.

36379378|t|The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the broadly active antiviral ribonucleoside N(4)-Hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931) in a mouse model of lethal Ebola virus infection.
36379378|a|The unprecedented magnitude of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in West Africa resulted in over 11 000 deaths and spurred an international public health emergency. A second outbreak in 2018-2020 in DRC resulted in an additional >3400 cases and nearly 2300 deaths (WHO, 2020). These large outbreaks across geographically diverse regions highlight the need for the development of effective oral therapeutic agents that can be easily distributed for self-administration to populations with active disease or at risk of infection. Herein, we report the in vivo efficacy of N(4)-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), a broadly active ribonucleoside analog and the active metabolite of the prodrug EIDD-2801 (molnupiravir), in murine models of lethal EBOV infection. Twice daily oral dosing with EIDD-1931 at 200 mg/kg for 7 days, initiated either with a prophylactic dose 2 h before infection, or as therapeutic treatment starting 6 h post-infection, resulted in 92-100% survival of mice challenged with lethal doses of EBOV, reduced clinical signs of Ebola virus disease (EVD), reduced serum virus titers, and facilitated weight loss recovery. These results support further investigation of molnupiravir as a potential therapeutic or prophylactic treatment for EVD.

36461100|t|Sustainable strategies for Ebola virus disease outbreak preparedness in Africa: a case study on lessons learnt in countries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
36461100|a|BACKGROUND: From May 2018 to September 2022, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experienced seven Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks within its borders. During the 10th EVD outbreak (2018-2020), the largest experienced in the DRC and the second largest and most prolonged EVD outbreak recorded globally, a WHO risk assessment identified nine countries bordering the DRC as moderate to high risk from cross border importation. These countries implemented varying levels of Ebola virus disease preparedness interventions. This case study highlights the gains and shortfalls with the Ebola virus disease preparedness interventions within the various contexts of these countries against the background of a renewed and growing commitment for global epidemic preparedness highlighted during recent World Health Assembly events. MAIN TEXT: Several positive impacts from preparedness support to countries bordering the affected provinces in the DRC were identified, including development of sustained capacities which were leveraged upon to respond to the subsequent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Shortfalls such as lost opportunities for operationalizing cross-border regional preparedness collaboration and better integration of multidisciplinary perspectives, vertical approaches to response pillars such as surveillance, over dependence on external support and duplication of efforts especially in areas of capacity building were also identified. A recurrent theme that emerged from this case study is the propensity towards implementing short-term interventions during active Ebola virus disease outbreaks for preparedness rather than sustainable investment into strengthening systems for improved health security in alignment with IHR obligations, the Sustainable Development Goals and advocating global policy for addressing the larger structural determinants underscoring these outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several international frameworks established at the global level for emergency preparedness, a shortfall exists between global policy and practice in countries at high risk of cross border transmission from persistent Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. With renewed global health commitment for country emergency preparedness resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and cumulating in a resolution for a pandemic preparedness treaty, the time to review and address these gaps and provide recommendations for more sustainable and integrative approaches to emergency preparedness towards achieving global health security is now.

36516078|t|Randomized Trial of Vaccines for Zaire Ebola Virus Disease.
36516078|a|BACKGROUND: Questions remain concerning the rapidity of immune responses and the durability and safety of vaccines used to prevent Zaire Ebola virus disease. METHODS: We conducted two randomized, placebo-controlled trials - one involving adults and one involving children - to evaluate the safety and immune responses of three vaccine regimens against Zaire Ebola virus disease: Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo 56 days later (the Ad26-MVA group), rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP followed by placebo 56 days later (the rVSV group), and rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP followed by rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP 56 days later (the rVSV-booster group). The primary end point was antibody response at 12 months, defined as having both a 12-month antibody concentration of at least 200 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter and an increase from baseline in the antibody concentration by at least a factor of 4. RESULTS: A total of 1400 adults and 1401 children underwent randomization. Among both adults and children, the incidence of injection-site reactions and symptoms (e.g., feverishness and headache) was higher in the week after receipt of the primary and second or booster vaccinations than after receipt of placebo but not at later time points. These events were largely low-grade. At month 12, a total of 41% of adults (titer, 401 EU per milliliter) and 78% of children (titer, 828 EU per milliliter) had a response in the Ad26-MVA group; 76% (titer, 992 EU per milliliter) and 87% (titer, 1415 EU per milliliter), respectively, had a response in the rVSV group; 81% (titer, 1037 EU per milliliter) and 93% (titer, 1745 EU per milliliter), respectively, had a response in the rVSV-booster group; and 3% (titer, 93 EU per milliliter) and 4% (titer, 67 EU per milliliter), respectively, had a response in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons of vaccine with placebo). In both adults and children, antibody responses with vaccine differed from those with placebo beginning on day 14. CONCLUSIONS: No safety concerns were identified in this trial. With all three vaccine regimens, immune responses were seen from day 14 through month 12.

36560788|t|Maternal Immunization Using a Protein Subunit Vaccine Mediates Passive Immunity against Zaire ebolavirus in a Murine Model.
36560788|a|The Ebola virus has caused outbreaks in Central and West Africa, with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Clinical trials of recombinant virally vectored vaccines did not explicitly include pregnant or nursing women, resulting in a gap in knowledge of vaccine-elicited maternal antibody and its potential transfer. The role of maternal antibody in Ebola virus disease and vaccination remains understudied. Here, we demonstrate that a protein subunit vaccine can elicit robust humoral responses in pregnant mice, which are transferred to pups in breastmilk. These findings indicate that an intramuscular protein subunit vaccine may elicit Ebola-specific IgG capable of being transferred across the placenta as well as into the breastmilk. We have previously shown protective efficacy with these vaccines in non-human primates, offering a potential safe and practical alternative to recombinant virally vectored vaccines for pregnant and nursing women in Ebola endemic regions.

36567023|t|History and impact of the mouse-adapted Ebola virus model.
36567023|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of the filoviridae family, which are comprised of negative sense, enveloped RNA hemorrhagic fever viruses that can cause severe disease and high lethality rates. These viruses require BSL-4 containment laboratories for study. Early studies of EBOV pathogenesis relied heavily on the use of nonhuman primates, which are expensive and cumbersome to handle in large numbers. Guinea pig models were also developed, but even to this day limited reagents are available in this model. In 1998, Mike Bray and colleagues developed a mouse-adapted EBOV (maEBOV) that caused lethality in adult immunocompetent mice. This model had significant advantages, including being inexpensive, allowing for higher animal numbers for statistical analysis, availability of reagents for studying pathogenesis, and availability of a vast array of genetically modified strains. The model has been used to test vaccines, therapeutic drugs, EBOV mutants, and pathogenesis, and its importance is demonstrated by the hundreds of citations referencing the original publication. This review will cover the history of the maEBOV model and its use in filovirus research.

36580440|t|In vivo characterization of the novel ebolavirus Bombali virus suggests a low pathogenic potential for humans.
36580440|a|Ebolaviruses cause outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in Central and West Africa. Some members of this genus such as Ebola virus (EBOV) are highly pathogenic, with case fatality rates of up to 90%, whereas others such as Reston virus (RESTV) are apathogenic for humans. Bombali virus (BOMV) is a novel ebolavirus for which complete genome sequences were recently found in free-tailed bats, although no infectious virus could be isolated. Its pathogenic potential for humans is unknown. To address this question, we first determined whether proteins encoded by the available BOMV sequence found in Chaerephon pumilus were functional in in vitro assays. The correction of an apparent sequencing error in the glycoprotein based on these data then allowed us to generate infectious BOMV using reverse genetics and characterize its infection of human cells. Furthermore, we used HLA-A2-transgenic, NOD-scid-IL-2gamma receptor-knockout (NSG-A2) mice reconstituted with human haematopoiesis as a model to evaluate the pathogenicity of BOMV in vivo in a human-like immune environment. These data demonstrate that not only does BOMV show a slower growth rate than EBOV in vitro, but it also shows low pathogenicity in humanized mice, comparable to previous studies using RESTV. Taken together, these findings suggest a low pathogenic potential of BOMV for humans.

36649296|t|Predicting the combined effects of case isolation, safe funeral practices, and contact tracing during Ebola virus disease outbreaks.
36649296|a|BACKGROUND: The recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Uganda and the Marburg virus disease (MVD) in Ghana reflect a persisting threat of Filoviridae to the global health community. Characteristic of Filoviridae are not just their high case fatality rates, but also that corpses are highly contagious and prone to cause infections in the absence of appropriate precautions. Vaccines against the most virulent Ebolavirus species, the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) are approved. However, there exists no approved vaccine or treatment against the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) which causes the current outbreak of EVD. Hence, the control of the outbreak relies on case isolation, safe funeral practices, and contact tracing. So far, the effectiveness of these control measures was studied only separately by epidemiological models, while the impact of their interaction is unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To sustain decision making in public health-emergency management, we introduce a predictive model to study the interaction of case isolation, safe funeral practices, and contact tracing. The model is a complex extension of an SEIR-type model, and serves as an epidemic preparedness tool. The model considers different phases of the EVD infections, the possibility of infections being treated in isolation (if appropriately diagnosed), in hospital (if not properly diagnosed), or at home (if the infected do not present to hospital for whatever reason). It is assumed that the corpses of those who died in isolation are buried with proper safety measures, while those who die outside isolation might be buried unsafely, such that transmission can occur during the funeral. Furthermore, the contacts of individuals in isolation will be traced. Based on parameter estimates from the scientific literature, the model suggests that proper diagnosis and hence isolation of cases has the highest impact in reducing the size of the outbreak. However, the combination of case isolation and safe funeral practices alone are insufficient to fully contain the epidemic under plausible parameters. This changes if these measures are combined with contact tracing. In addition, shortening the time to successfully trace back contacts contribute substantially to contain the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of an approved vaccine and treatment, EVD management by proper and fast diagnostics in combination with epidemic awareness are fundamental. Awareness will particularly facilitate contact tracing and safe funeral practices. Moreover, proper and fast diagnostics are a major determinant of case isolation. The model introduced here is not just applicable to EVD, but also to other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as the MVD or the Lassa fever.

36652443|t|Ebola virus disrupts the inner blood-retinal barrier by induction of vascular endothelial growth factor in pericytes.
36652443|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with high mortality. In Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors, EBOV persistence in the eyes may break through the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB), leading to ocular complications and EVD recurrence. However, the mechanism by which EBOV affects the iBRB remains unclear. Here, we used the in vitro iBRB model to simulate EBOV in retinal tissue and found that Ebola virus-like particles (EBO-VLPs) could disrupt the iBRB. Cytokine screening revealed that EBO-VLPs stimulate pericytes to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to cause iBRB breakdown. VEGF downregulates claudin-1 to disrupt the iBRB. Ebola glycoprotein is crucial for VEGF stimulation and iBRB breakdown. Furthermore, EBO-VLPs caused iBRB breakdown by stimulating VEGF in rats. This study provides a mechanistic insight into that EBOV disrupts the iBRB, which will assist in developing new strategies to treat EBOV persistence in EVD survivors.

36804324|t|Ebola virus disease: In vivo protection provided by the PAMP restricted TLR3 agonist rintatolimod and its mechanism of action.
36804324|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly infectious and lethal pathogen responsible for sporadic self-limiting clusters of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Central Africa capable of reaching epidemic status. 100% protection from lethal EBOV-Zaire in Balb/c mice was achieved by rintatolimod (Ampligen) at the well tolerated human clinical dose of 6 mg/kg. The data indicate that the mechanism of action is rintatolimod's dual ability to act as both a competitive decoy for the IID domain of VP35 blocking viral dsRNA sequestration and as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) restricted agonist for direct TLR3 activation but lacking RIG-1-like cytosolic helicase agonist properties. These data show promise for rintatolimod as a prophylactic therapy against human Ebola outbreaks.

36817425|t|Approaches to demonstrating the effectiveness of filovirus vaccines: Lessons from Ebola and COVID-19.
36817425|a|Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are members of the Filoviridae family that can cause severe disease and death in humans and animals. The reemergence of Ebola, Sudan and Marburg virus disease highlight the need for continued availability of safe and effectives vaccines as well as development of new vaccines. While randomized controlled trials using disease endpoints provide the most robust assessment of vaccine effectiveness, challenges to this approach include the unpredictable size, location, occurrence and duration of filovirus disease outbreaks. Thus, other approaches to demonstrating vaccine effectiveness have been considered. These approaches are discussed using examples of preventive vaccines against other infectious diseases. In addition, this article proposes a clinical immunobridging strategy using licensed EBOV vaccines as comparators for demonstrating the effectiveness of filovirus vaccine candidates that are based on the same licensed vaccine platform technology.

36851550|t|Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Rapid Point of Care Test for Ebola Virus Infection in Humans.
36851550|a|The genus Ebolavirus contains multiple species of viruses that are highly contagious and lethal, often causing severe hemorrhagic fever. To minimize the global threat from Ebola virus disease (EVD), sustainable, field-appropriate tools are needed to quickly screen and triage symptomatic patients and conduct rapid screening of cadavers to ensure proper handling of human remains. The OraQuick((R)) Ebola Rapid Antigen Test is an in vitro diagnostic single-use immunoassay for the qualitative detection of Ebola virus antigens that detects all known species within the genus Ebolavirus. Here, we report the performance of the OraQuick((R)) Ebola Rapid Antigen Test and provide a comparison of its performance with other rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for EVD. OraQuick((R)) Ebola demonstrated clinical sensitivity of 84.0% in archived EVD patient venous whole-blood (WB) samples, 90.9% in Ebola virus-infected monkey fingerstick samples, and 97.1% in EVD patient cadaver buccal swabs, as well as clinical specificity of 98.0-100% in venous WB samples and 99.1-100% in contrived saliva samples. It is the only 510(k)-cleared Ebola rapid test, has analytical sensitivity as good as or better than all RDT comparators for EVD, and can detect the Sudan virus. Our data demonstrate that the OraQuick((R)) Ebola Rapid Antigen Test is a sensitive and specific assay that can be used for rapid detection of EBOV in humans and could support efforts for EVD-specific interventions and control over outbreaks.

36967128|t|Addressing the Threat of Emerging Viral Infections.
36967128|a|Emerging infections are caused when microorganisms that are maintained in a reservoir where they cause no harm, transmit from the reservoir to a new host. I have been studying the replication, molecular basis for pathogenesis, and host responses to emerging viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2, and using the knowledge gained from these studies to develop antivirals and vaccines.Influenza viruses cause epidemics every winter, but occasionally new influenza viruses emerge and spread worldwide (pandemic). We established a technique that allows us to make influenza viruses artificially. This technique is now widely used for basic research and for the development of vaccines against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus for pandemic preparedness and live attenuated influenza vaccines. Using this technique, we elucidated the mechanisms of emergence of pandemic viruses, viral replication, and the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis.Ebola virus causes severe disease with a mortality rate of up to 90%. In 2013, a major outbreak of Ebola virus began in West Africa that led to nearly 30,000 people being infected and a death toll of over 10,000 people. During the outbreak, we established a laboratory in Sierra Leone and used samples from Ebola patients to study host responses and identify biomarkers for severe infection. We also established a technology to artificially make Ebola virus and used this technology to make an Ebola virus that grows only in a particular cell line. Using this virus, we produced an inactivated Ebola vaccine, which was shown to be safe and effective in a Phase I clinical trial.Late in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China and has since caused unprecedented damage globally. In our laboratory, we established an animal model for this infection and have used it to evaluate pathogenicity, efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and antivirals, and to develop vaccines.In my presentation, I will discuss our findings regarding these emerging viral infections.

37021830|t|N'-Phenylacetohydrazide Derivatives as Potent Ebola Virus Entry Inhibitors with an Improved Pharmacokinetic Profile.
37021830|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is a single-strand RNA virus belonging to the Filoviridae family, which has been associated to most Ebola virus disease outbreaks to date, including the West African and the North Kivu epidemics between 2013 and 2022. This unprecedented health emergency prompted the search for effective medical countermeasures. Following up on the carbazole hit identified in our previous studies, we synthetized a new series of compounds, which demonstrated to prevent EBOV infection in cells by acting as virus entry inhibitors. The in vitro inhibitory activity was evaluated through the screening against surrogate models based on viral pseudotypes and further confirmed using replicative EBOV. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations joined to saturation transfer difference-nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) and mutagenesis experiments to elucidate the biological target of the most potent compounds. Finally, in vitro metabolic stability and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were performed to confirm their therapeutic potential.

37029928|t|Systematic analysis of human antibody response to ebolavirus glycoprotein shows high prevalence of neutralizing public clonotypes.
37029928|a|Understanding the human antibody response to emerging viral pathogens is key to epidemic preparedness. As the size of the B cell response to a pathogenic-virus-protective antigen is poorly defined, we perform deep paired heavy- and light-chain sequencing in Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP)-specific memory B cells, allowing analysis of the ebolavirus-specific antibody repertoire both genetically and functionally. This approach facilitates investigation of the molecular and genetic basis for the evolution of cross-reactive antibodies by elucidating germline-encoded properties of antibodies to EBOV and identification of the overlap between antibodies in the memory B cell and serum repertoire. We identify 73 public clonotypes of EBOV, 20% of which encode antibodies with neutralization activity and capacity to protect mice in vivo. This comprehensive analysis of the public and private antibody repertoire provides insight into the molecular basis of the humoral immune response to EBOV GP, which informs the design of vaccines and improved therapeutics.

37047270|t|Cheminformatics-Based Study Identifies Potential Ebola VP40 Inhibitors.
37047270|a|The Ebola virus (EBOV) is still highly infectious and causes severe hemorrhagic fevers in primates. However, there are no regulatorily approved drugs against the Ebola virus disease (EVD). The highly virulent and lethal nature of EVD highlights the need to develop therapeutic agents. Viral protein 40 kDa (VP40), the most abundantly expressed protein during infection, coordinates the assembly, budding, and release of viral particles into the host cell. It also regulates viral transcription and RNA replication. This study sought to identify small molecules that could potentially inhibit the VP40 protein by targeting the N-terminal domain using an in silico approach. The statistical quality of AutoDock Vina's capacity to discriminate between inhibitors and decoys was determined, and an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of 0.791 was obtained. A total of 29,519 natural-product-derived compounds from Chinese and African sources as well as 2738 approved drugs were successfully screened against VP40. Using a threshold of -8 kcal/mol, a total of 7, 11, 163, and 30 compounds from the AfroDb, Northern African Natural Products Database (NANPDB), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and approved drugs libraries, respectively, were obtained after molecular docking. A biological activity prediction of the lead compounds suggested their potential antiviral properties. In addition, random-forest- and support-vector-machine-based algorithms predicted the compounds to be anti-Ebola with IC(50) values in the micromolar range (less than 25 muM). A total of 42 natural-product-derived compounds were identified as potential EBOV inhibitors with desirable ADMET profiles, comprising 1, 2, and 39 compounds from NANPDB (2-hydroxyseneganolide), AfroDb (ZINC000034518176 and ZINC000095485942), and TCM, respectively. A total of 23 approved drugs, including doramectin, glecaprevir, velpatasvir, ledipasvir, avermectin B1, nafarelin acetate, danoprevir, eltrombopag, lanatoside C, and glycyrrhizin, among others, were also predicted to have potential anti-EBOV activity and can be further explored so that they may be repurposed for EVD treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area calculations corroborated the stability and good binding affinities of the complexes (-46.97 to -118.9 kJ/mol). The potential lead compounds may have the potential to be developed as anti-EBOV drugs after experimental testing.

37061918|t|Antibodies against the Ebola virus soluble glycoprotein are associated with long-term vaccine-mediated protection of non-human primates.
37061918|a|The 2013 Ebola epidemic in Central and West Africa heralded the emergence of wide-spread, highly pathogenic viruses. The successful recombinant vector vaccine against Ebola (rVSVDeltaG-ZEBOV-GP) will limit future outbreaks, but identifying mechanisms of protection is essential to protect the most vulnerable. Vaccine-induced antibodies are key determinants of vaccine efficacy, yet the mechanism by which vaccine-induced antibodies prevent Ebola infection remains elusive. Here, we exploit a break in long-term vaccine efficacy in non-human primates to identify predictors of protection. Using unbiased humoral profiling that captures neutralization and Fc-mediated functions, we find that antibodies specific for soluble glycoprotein (sGP) drive neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis and predict vaccine-mediated protection. Similarly, we show that protective sGP-specific monoclonal antibodies have elevated neutrophil-mediated phagocytic activity compared with non-protective antibodies, highlighting the importance of sGP in vaccine protection and monoclonal antibody therapeutics against Ebola virus.

37099841|t|Immune response of a two-dose heterologous Ebola vaccine regimen: summary of three African clinical trials using a single validated Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a single accredited laboratory.
37099841|a|BACKGROUND: This analysis evaluated the immune response to the two-dose, heterologous Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo Ebola virus vaccine regimen, administered 56-days apart, from multiple African sites based on results from one analytic laboratory. METHODS: Immunogenicity across three trials (EBL2002, EBL2004/PREVAC, EBL3001) conducted in East and West Africa is summarised. Vaccine-induced Ebola glycoprotein-binding antibody concentrations were analysed by Q(2) Solutions laboratory at baseline, 21 days (EBL2002 and EBL3001) or 28 days (EBL2004) post-dose 2 (regimen completion), and 12 months post-dose 1 using the validated Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group Ebola glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Responders were defined as those with a >2.5-fold increase from baseline or the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) if <LLOQ at baseline. FINDINGS: At 21 or 28 (21/28) days post-dose 2, the geometric mean concentration (GMC) range was 3810-7518 ELISA units (EU)/mL (percent responders: >/=98%) in adults, 9929-13532 EU/mL (>/=98%) in adolescents aged 12-17 years, 10,212-17388 EU/mL (>/=99%) in older children, and 22,568-25111 EU/mL (>/=98%) in younger children. When stratified by country, GMCs at 21/28 days post-dose 2 were generally similar among adults and within paediatric cohorts (percent responders: 95%-100%). At month 12, GMC range was 259-437 EU/mL (percent responders: 49%-88%) in adults and 386-1139 EU/mL (70%-100%) in paediatric participants. INTERPRETATION: Based on data from a single laboratory using a single validated assay, Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo induced a strong humoral immune response, with >/=95% of participants across countries classified as responders at 21/28 days post-dose 2 (regimen completion), regardless of age.

37153606|t|Immune correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and Nipah virus infection.
37153606|a|Correlates of protection (CoP) are biological parameters that predict a certain level of protection against an infectious disease. Well-established correlates of protection facilitate the development and licensing of vaccines by assessing protective efficacy without the need to expose clinical trial participants to the infectious agent against which the vaccine aims to protect. Despite the fact that viruses have many features in common, correlates of protection can vary considerably amongst the same virus family and even amongst a same virus depending on the infection phase that is under consideration. Moreover, the complex interplay between the various immune cell populations that interact during infection and the high degree of genetic variation of certain pathogens, renders the identification of immune correlates of protection difficult. Some emerging and re-emerging viruses of high consequence for public health such as SARS-CoV-2, Nipah virus (NiV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are especially challenging with regards to the identification of CoP since these pathogens have been shown to dysregulate the immune response during infection. Whereas, virus neutralising antibodies and polyfunctional T-cell responses have been shown to correlate with certain levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV, other effector mechanisms of immunity play important roles in shaping the immune response against these pathogens, which in turn might serve as alternative correlates of protection. This review describes the different components of the adaptive and innate immune system that are activated during SARS-CoV-2, EBOV and NiV infections and that may contribute to protection and virus clearance. Overall, we highlight the immune signatures that are associated with protection against these pathogens in humans and could be used as CoP.

37170900|t|Hepatic proinflammatory myeloid phenotypes are a hallmark of Ebola virus Kikwit pathogenesis in rhesus monkeys.
37170900|a|The liver is an early systemic target of Ebola virus (EBOV), but characterization beyond routine histopathology and viral antigen distribution is limited. We hypothesized Ebola virus disease (EVD) systemic proinflammatory responses would be reflected in temporally altered liver myeloid phenotypes. We utilized multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry (mfIHC), multispectral whole slide imaging, and image analysis to quantify molecular phenotypes of myeloid cells in the liver of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 21) infected with EBOV Kikwit. Liver samples included uninfected controls (n = 3), 3 days postinoculation (DPI; n = 3), 4 DPI (n = 3), 5 DPI (n = 3), 6 DPI (n = 3), and terminal disease (6-8 DPI; n = 6). Alterations in hepatic macrophages occurred at >/= 5 DPI characterized by a 1.4-fold increase in CD68+ immunoreactivity and a transition from primarily CD14(-)CD16(+) to CD14(+)CD16(-) macrophages, with a 2.1-fold decrease in CD163 expression in terminal animals compared with uninfected controls. An increase in the neutrophil chemoattractant and alarmin S100A9 occurred within hepatic myeloid cells at 5 DPI, followed by rapid neutrophil influx at >/= 6 DPI. An acute rise in the antiviral myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MxA) occurred at >/= 4 DPI, with a predilection for enhanced expression in uninfected cells. Distinctive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II was observed in hepatocytes during terminal disease. Results illustrate that EBOV causes macrophage phenotype alterations as well as neutrophil influx and prominent activation of interferon host responses in the liver. Results offer insight into potential therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or modulate the host proinflammatory response to normalize hepatic myeloid functionality.

37184428|t|Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Monitoring of Hepatic Disease Induced by Ebola Virus: a Nonhuman Primate Proof-of-Concept Study.
37184428|a|Severe liver impairment is a well-known hallmark of Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, the role of hepatic involvement in EVD progression is understudied. Medical imaging in established animal models of EVD (e.g., nonhuman primates [NHPs]) can be a strong complement to traditional assays to better investigate this pathophysiological process in vivo and noninvasively. In this proof-of-concept study, we used longitudinal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize liver morphology and function in nine rhesus monkeys after exposure to Ebola virus (EBOV). Starting 5 days postexposure, MRI assessments of liver appearance, morphology, and size were consistently compatible with the presence of hepatic edema, inflammation, and congestion, leading to significant hepatomegaly at necropsy. MRI performed after injection of a hepatobiliary contrast agent demonstrated decreased liver signal on the day of euthanasia, suggesting progressive hepatocellular dysfunction and hepatic secretory impairment associated with EBOV infection. Importantly, MRI-assessed deterioration of biliary function was acute and progressed faster than changes in serum bilirubin concentrations. These findings suggest that longitudinal quantitative in vivo imaging may be a useful addition to standard biological assays to gain additional knowledge about organ pathophysiology in animal models of EVD. IMPORTANCE Severe liver impairment is a well-known hallmark of Ebola virus disease (EVD), but the contribution of hepatic pathophysiology to EVD progression is not fully understood. Noninvasive medical imaging of liver structure and function in well-established animal models of disease may shed light on this important aspect of EVD. In this proof-of-concept study, we used longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize liver abnormalities and dysfunction in rhesus monkeys exposed to Ebola virus. The results indicate that in vivo MRI may be used as a noninvasive readout of organ pathophysiology in EVD and may be used in future animal studies to further characterize organ-specific damage of this condition, in addition to standard biological assays.

37186162|t|Single-Dose Treatment With Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Based Ebola Virus Vaccine Expressing Ebola Virus-Specific Artificial Micro-RNA Does Not Protect Mice From Lethal Disease.
37186162|a|Although significant progress has been made in the development of therapeutics against Ebola virus (EBOV), we sought to expand upon existing strategies and combine an RNA interference-based intervention with the approved vesicular stomatitis virus-based Ebola virus (VSV-EBOV) vaccine to conjointly treat and vaccinate patients during an outbreak. We constructed VSV-EBOV vectors expressing artificial micro-RNAs (amiRNAs) targeting sequences of EBOV proteins. In vitro experiments demonstrated a robust decrease in EBOV replication using a minigenome system and infectious virus. For in vivo evaluation, mouse-adapted EBOV-infected CD-1 mice were treated 24 hours after infection with a single dose of the VSV-EBOV amiRNA constructs. We observed no difference in disease progression or survival compared to the control-treated mice. In summary, while amiRNAs decrease viral replication in vitro, the effect is not sufficient to protect mice from lethal disease, and this therapeutic approach requires further optimization.

37196593|t|Ebola virus disease: A review for the emergency medicine clinician.
37196593|a|INTRODUCTION: Ebolavirus, the causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks mainly in sub-Saharan Africa since 1976. EVD is associated with high risk of transmission, especially to healthcare workers during patient care. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide a concise review of EVD presentation, diagnosis, and management for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: EVD is spread through direct contact, including blood, bodily fluids or contact with a contaminated object. Patients may present with non-specific symptoms such as fevers, myalgias, vomiting, or diarrhea that overlap with other viral illnesses, but rash, bruising, and bleeding may also occur. Laboratory analysis may reveal transaminitis, coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The average clinical course is approximately 8-10 days with an average case fatality rate of 50%. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, with two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibody treatments (Ebanga and Inmazeb). Survivors of the disease may have a complicated recovery, marked by long-term symptoms. CONCLUSION: EVD is a potentially deadly condition that can present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the presentation, evaluation, and management to optimize the care of these patients.

37243162|t|Ebolavirus Species-Specific Interferon Antagonism Mediated by VP24.
37243162|a|Members of the Ebolavirus genus demonstrate a marked differences in pathogenicity in humans with Ebola (EBOV) being the most pathogenic, Bundibugyo (BDBV) less pathogenic, and Reston (RESTV) is not known to cause a disease in humans. The VP24 protein encoded by members of the Ebolavirus genus blocks type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling through interaction with host karyopherin alpha nuclear transporters, potentially contributing to virulence. Previously, we demonstrated that BDBV VP24 (bVP24) binds with lower affinities to karyopherin alpha proteins relative to EBOV VP24 (eVP24), and this correlated with a reduced inhibition in IFN-I signaling. We hypothesized that modification of eVP24-karyopherin alpha interface to make it similar to bVP24 would attenuate the ability to antagonize IFN-I response. We generated a panel of recombinant EBOVs containing single or combinations of point mutations in the eVP24-karyopherin alpha interface. Most of the viruses appeared to be attenuated in both IFN-I-competent 769-P and IFN-I-deficient Vero-E6 cells in the presence of IFNs. However, the R140A mutant grew at reduced levels even in the absence of IFNs in both cell lines, as well as in U3A STAT1 knockout cells. Both the R140A mutation and its combination with the N135A mutation greatly reduced the amounts of viral genomic RNA and mRNA suggesting that these mutations attenuate the virus in an IFN-I-independent attenuation. Additionally, we found that unlike eVP24, bVP24 does not inhibit interferon lambda 1 (IFN-lambda1), interferon beta (IFN-beta), and ISG15, which potentially explains the lower pathogenicity of BDBV relative to EBOV. Thus, the VP24 residues binding karyopherin alpha attenuates the virus by IFN-I-dependent and independent mechanisms.

37279544|t|Ebola Virus Disease Features Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome in the Rhesus Macaque Model.
37279544|a|BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is one of the most severe and fatal viral hemorrhagic fevers and appears to mimic many clinical and laboratory manifestations of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLS), also known as macrophage activation syndrome. However, a clear association is yet to be firmly established for effective host-targeted, immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes in patients with severe EVD. METHODS: Twenty-four rhesus monkeys were exposed intramuscularly to the EBOV Kikwit isolate and euthanized at prescheduled time points or when they reached the end-stage disease criteria. Three additional monkeys were mock-exposed and used as uninfected controls. RESULTS: EBOV-exposed monkeys presented with clinicopathologic features of HLS, including fever, multiple organomegaly, pancytopenia, hemophagocytosis, hyperfibrinogenemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercytokinemia, increased concentrations of soluble CD163 and CD25 in serum, and the loss of activated natural killer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that EVD in the rhesus macaque model mimics pathophysiologic features of HLS/macrophage activation syndrome. Hence, regulating inflammation and immune function might provide an effective treatment for controlling the pathogenesis of acute EVD.

37288609|t|A Pan-Ebolavirus Monoclonal Antibody Cocktail Provides Protection Against Ebola and Sudan Viruses.
37288609|a|Filoviruses, including ebolaviruses and marburgviruses, can cause severe and often fatal disease in humans. Over the past several years, antibody therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of filovirus disease. Here, we describe 2 distinct cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from mice immunized with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based filovirus vaccines. Both mAbs recognized the glycoproteins of multiple different ebolaviruses and exhibited broad but differential in vitro neutralization activities against these viruses. By themselves, each mAb provided partial to full protection against Ebola virus in mice, and in combination, the mAbs provided 100% protection against Sudan virus challenge in guinea pigs. This study identified novel mAbs that were elicited through immunization and able to provide protection from ebolavirus infection, thus enriching the pool of candidate therapeutics for treating Ebola disease.

37290053|t|A Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Based Vaccine Provides Postexposure Protection Against Bundibugyo Ebolavirus Infection.
37290053|a|BACKGROUND: The filovirus Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) causes severe disease with a mortality rate of approximately 20%-51%. The only licensed filovirus vaccine in the United States, Ervebo, consists of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector that expresses Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP). Ervebo was shown to rapidly protect against fatal Ebola disease in clinical trials; however, the vaccine is only indicated against EBOV. Recent outbreaks of other filoviruses underscore the need for additional vaccine candidates, particularly for BDBV infections. METHODS: To examine whether the rVSV vaccine candidate rVSVDeltaG/BDBV-GP could provide therapeutic protection against BDBV, we inoculated seven cynomolgus macaques with 1000 plaque-forming units of BDBV, administering rVSVDeltaG/BDBV-GP vaccine to 6 of them 20-23 minutes after infection. RESULTS: Five of the treated animals survived infection (83%) compared to an expected natural survival rate of 21% in this macaque model. All treated animals showed an early circulating immune response, while the untreated animal did not. Surviving animals showed evidence of both GP-specific IgM and IgG production, while animals that succumbed did not produce significant IgG. CONCLUSIONS: This small, proof-of-concept study demonstrated early treatment with rVSVDeltaG/BDBV-GP provides a survival benefit in this nonhuman primate model of BDBV infection, perhaps through earlier initiation of adaptive immunity.

37348509|t|Natural History of Nonhuman Primates After Oral Exposure to Ebola Virus Variant Makona.
37348509|a|BACKGROUND: The primary route of infection by Ebola virus (EBOV) is through contact of mucosal surfaces. Few studies have explored infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) via the oral mucosa, which is a probable portal of natural infection in humans. METHODS: To further characterize the pathogenesis of EBOV infection via the oral exposure route, we challenged cohorts of cynomolgus monkeys with low doses of EBOV variant Makona. RESULTS: Infection with 100 or 50 PFU of EBOV Makona via the oral route resulted in 50% and 83% lethality, respectively. Animals that progressed to fatal disease exhibited lymphopenia, marked coagulopathy, high viral loads, and increased levels of serum markers of inflammation and hepatic/renal injury. Survival in these cohorts was associated with milder fluctuations in leukocyte populations, lack of coagulopathy, and reduced or absent serum markers of inflammation and/or hepatic/renal function. Surprisingly, 2 surviving animals from the 100- and 50-PFU cohorts developed transient low-level viremia in the absence of other clinical signs of disease. Conversely, all animals in the 10 PFU cohort remained disease free and survived to the study end point. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations highlight the susceptibility of NHPs, and by extension, likely humans, to relatively low doses of EBOV via the oral route.

37348869|t|RNA Editing as a General Trait of Ebolaviruses.
37348869|a|RNA editing has been discovered as an essential mechanism for the transcription of the glycoprotein (GP) gene of Ebola virus but not Marburg virus. We developed a rapid transcript quantification assay (RTQA) to analyze RNA transcripts generated through RNA editing and used immunoblotting with a pan-ebolavirus monoclonal antibody to confirm different GP gene-derived products. RTQA successfully quantified GP gene transcripts during infection with representative members of 5 ebolavirus species. Immunoblotting verified expression of the soluble GP and the transmembrane GP. Our results defined RNA editing as a general trait of ebolaviruses. The degree of editing, however, varies among ebolaviruses with Reston virus showing the lowest and Bundibugyo virus the highest degree of editing.

37349033|t|Pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and infant growth and development after recovery from Ebola virus disease in Liberia: an observational cohort study.
37349033|a|BACKGROUND: Minimal data exist on pregnancy following recovery from Ebola in people of child-bearing potential (females aged roughly 18-45 years). The aim of this study was to assess viral persistence or reactivation in pregnancy, the frequency of placental transfer of anti-Ebola IgG antibodies, and pregnancy outcomes in this population. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we studied self-reported pregnancies in two groups: seropositive people who had recovered from Ebola virus disease (seropositive group) and seronegative people who had close contact with people with Ebola (seronegative group). Participants had enrolled in the PREVAIL III longitudinal study and were exposed during the 2014-2016 Liberian Ebola outbreak. The primary outcome was pregnancy result. We assessed rates of livebirths and other pregnancy results in both study groups, and presence of Ebola RNA by PCR in samples of placenta, maternal and cord blood, breastmilk, and vaginal secretions from people who had recovered from Ebola who conceived a median of 14 months after acute Ebola virus disease. Mixed-model logistic regression evaluated associations between first-reported pregnancy outcome, age, and study group. Growth and neurodevelopment in the infants born to people in the seropositive group were assessed at 6-month intervals for 2 years. Data were accrued by PREVAIL III study staff. FINDINGS: 1566 participants were enrolled between June 17, 2015, and Dec 14, 2017, of whom 639 became pregnant (215 seropositive, 424 seronegative) and 589 reported pregnancy outcomes (206 seropositive, 383 seronegative). 105 infants born to 98 mothers in the seropositive group were enrolled in the birth cohort. Ebola RNA was not detected in 205 samples of placenta, cord blood, or maternal blood taken at birth from 54 mothers in the seropositive group, nor in 367 vaginal swabs. Viral RNA was found in two of 354 longitudinal breastmilk samples. All but one of 57 infants born during these 54 births were seropositive for anti-Ebola antibodies. Neonates showed high concentrations of anti-Ebola IgG, which declined after 6 months. Odds of adverse pregnancy outcome among the two groups were indistinguishable (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71-1.79). Compared with WHO standards, infants born to those in the seropositive group had lower median weight and length, and larger median head circumference over 2 years. Compared with a cohort from the USA accrual of gross motor developmental milestones was similar, whereas attainment of pincer grasp and early vocalisation were mildly delayed. INTERPRETATION: The risks of Ebola virus reactivation in the peripartum and postpartum period and of adverse birth outcomes are low in those who have recovered from Ebola virus disease and become pregnant approximately 1 year after acute Ebola virus disease. The implication for clinical practice is that care of people who are pregnant and who have recovered from Ebola can be offered without risks to health-care providers or stigmatisation of the mothers and their offspring. The implication for prospective mothers is that safe pregnancies are entirely possible after recovery from Ebola.

37386692|t|Ebola Virus Tropism in Ex Vivo Cynomolgus Macaque Ocular Tissues.
37386692|a|Ocular complications of Ebola virus disease are well-documented and long-term sequelae in survivors are common and lead to considerable morbidity. However, little is currently known regarding EBOV's tropism and replication kinetics within the eye. To date, limited studies have utilized in vitro infections of ocular cell lines and analyses of archived pathology samples to investigate these issues. Here, we employed ex vivo cultures of cynomolgus macaque eyes to determine the tropism of EBOV in 7 different ocular tissues: cornea, anterior sclera with bulbar conjunctiva, ciliary body, iris, lens, neural retina, and retina pigment epithelium. We report that, except for neural retina, all tissues supported EBOV replication. Retina pigment epithelium produced the fastest growth and highest viral RNA loads, although the differences were not statistically significant. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed and further characterized infection. This study demonstrates that EBOV has a broad tropism within the eye.

37392670|t|A review of broadly protective monoclonal antibodies to treat Ebola virus disease.
37392670|a|The filovirus vaccine and the therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) research have made substantial progress. However, existing vaccines and mAbs approved for use in humans are specific to Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). Since other Ebolavirus species are a continuing threat to public health, the search for broadly protective mAbs has drawn attention. Here, we review viral glycoprotein-targeting mAbs that have proved their broader protective efficacy in animal models. MBP134(AF), the most advanced of these new-generation mAb therapies, has recently been deployed in Uganda during the Sudan ebolavirus outbreak. Furthermore, we discuss the measures associated with enhancing antibody therapies and the risks associated with them, including the rise of escape mutations following the mAb treatment and naturally occurring EBOV variants.

37469133|a|BACKGROUND: Ebolaviruses Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and Bundibugyo (BDBV) cause severe human disease, which may be accompanied by hemorrhagic syndrome, with high case fatality rates. Monovalent vaccines do not offer cross-protection against these viruses whose endemic areas overlap. Therefore, development of a panebolavirus vaccine is a priority. As a vaccine vector, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) has the advantages of needle-free administration and induction of both systemic and local mucosal antibody responses in the respiratory tract. METHODS: To minimize the antivector immunity, genes encoding the HPIV3 envelope proteins F and HN were removed from the vaccine constructs, resulting in expression of only the ebolavirus envelope protein-glycoprotein. These second-generation vaccine constructs were used to develop a combination vaccine against EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV. RESULTS: A single intranasal vaccination of guinea pigs or ferrets with the trivalent combination vaccine elicited humoral responses to each of the targeted ebolaviruses, including binding and neutralizing antibodies, as well as Fc-mediated effector functions. This vaccine protected animals from death and disease caused by lethal challenges with EBOV, SUDV, or BDBV. CONCLUSIONS: The combination vaccine elicited protection that was comparable to that induced by the monovalent vaccines, thus demonstrating the value of this combination trivalent vaccine.

37474155|t|Limited Benefit of Postexposure Prophylaxis With VSV-EBOV in Ebola Virus-Infected Rhesus Macaques.
37474155|a|Vesicular stomatitis virus-Ebola virus (VSV-EBOV) vaccine has been successfully used in ring vaccination approaches during EBOV disease outbreaks demonstrating its general benefit in short-term prophylactic vaccination, but actual proof of its benefit in true postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for humans is missing. Animal studies have indicated PEP efficacy when VSV-EBOV was used within hours of lethal EBOV challenge. Here, we used a lower EBOV challenge dose and a combined intravenous and intramuscular VSV-EBOV administration to improve PEP efficacy in the rhesus macaque model. VSV-EBOV treatment 1 hour after EBOV challenge resulted in delayed disease progression but little benefit in outcome. Thus, we could not confirm previous results indicating questionable benefit of VSV-EBOV for EBOV PEP in a nonhuman primate model.

37477943|t|Atypical Ebola Virus Disease in a Rhesus Macaque.
37477943|a|Ebola virus (EBOV)-Makona infected more than 30 000 people from 2013 to 2016 in West Africa, among them many health care workers including foreign nationals. Most of the infected foreign nationals were evacuated and treated in their respective home countries, resulting in detailed reports of the acute disease following EBOV infection as well as descriptions of symptoms now known as post-Ebola syndrome, which occurred months after the infection. Symptoms associated with this syndrome include uveitis and neurological manifestations. In 1 of our EBOV-Makona nonhuman primate (NHP) studies, 1 NHP was euthanized on day 28 after infection having completely recovered from the acute disease. During convalescence, this NHP developed neurological signs and acute respiratory distress requiring euthanasia. The organ tropism had changed with high virus titers in lungs, brain, eye, and reproductive organs but no virus in the typical target organs for acute EBOV infection. This in part reflects sequelae described for EBOV survivors albeit developing quicker after recovery from acute disease.

37515275|t|The Susceptibility of BALB/c Mice to a Mouse-Adapted Ebola Virus Intravaginal Infection.
37515275|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) causes Ebola virus disease (EVD), which is characterized by hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans. EBOV sexual transmission has been a concern since the 2014-2016 outbreak in Africa, as persistent infection in the testis and transmission to women was demonstrated. The only study related to establishing an intravaginal small animal infection model was recently documented in IFNAR(-/-) mice using wild-type and mouse-adapted EBOV (maEBOV), and resulted in 80% mortality, supporting epidemiological data. However, this route of transmission is still poorly understood in women, and the resulting EVD from it is understudied. Here, we contribute to this field of research by providing data from immunocompetent BALB/c mice. We demonstrate that progesterone priming increased the likelihood of maEBOV vaginal infection and of exhibiting the symptoms of disease and seroconversion. However, our data suggest subclinical infection, regardless of the infective dose. We conclude that maEBOV can infect BALB/c mice through vaginal inoculation, but that this route of infection causes significantly less disease compared to intraperitoneal injection at a similar dose, which is consistent with previous studies using other peripheral routes of inoculation in that animal model. Our data are inconsistent with the disease severity described in female patients, therefore suggesting that BALB/c mice are unsuitable for modeling typical EVD following vaginal challenge with maEBOV. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which EVD is attenuated in BALB/c mice, using maEBOV via the vaginal route, as in our experimental set-up.

37534818|t|Inequitable access to Ebola vaccines and the resurgence of Ebola in Africa: A state of arts review.
37534818|a|The Ebola virus, a member of the filoviridae family of viruses, is responsible for causing Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) with a case fatality rate as high as 50%. The largest EVD outbreak was recorded in West Africa from March 2013 to June 2016, leading to over 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths. It affected several countries, including Nigeria, Senegal, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Until then, EVD was predominantly reported in remote villages in central and west Africa close to tropical rainforests. Human mobility, behavioral and cultural norms, the use of bushmeat, burial customs, preference for traditional remedies and treatments, and resistance to health interventions are just a few of the social factors that considerably aid and amplify the risk of transmission. The scale and persistence of recent ebola outbreaks, as well as the risk of widespread global transmission and its ability for bioterrorism, have led to a rethinking of public health strategies to curb the disease, such as the expedition of Ebola vaccine production. However, as vaccine production lags in the subcontinent, among other challenges, the risk of another ebola outbreak is likely and feared by public health authorities in the region. This review describes the inequality of vaccine production in Africa and the resurgence of EVD, emphasizing the significance of health equality.

37544326|t|Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Ebola Sudan chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine (cAd3-EBO S) in healthy Ugandan adults: a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial.
37544326|a|BACKGROUND: Sudan Ebola virus can cause severe viral disease, with an average case fatality rate of 54%. A recent outbreak of Sudan Ebola virus in Uganda caused 55 deaths among 164 confirmed cases in the second half of 2022. Although vaccines and therapeutics specific for Zaire Ebola virus have been approved for use during outbreak situations, Sudan Ebola virus is an antigenically distinct virus with no approved vaccines available. METHODS: In this phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a monovalent chimpanzee adenovirus 3 vaccine against Sudan Ebola virus (cAd3-EBO S) at Makerere University Walter Reed Project in Kampala, Uganda. Study participants were recruited from the Kampala metropolitan area using International Review Board-approved written and electronic media explaining the trial intervention. Healthy adults without previous receipt of Ebola, Marburg, or cAd3 vectored-vaccines were enrolled to receive cAd3-EBO S at either 1 x 10(10) or 1 x 10(11) particle units (PU) in a single intramuscular vaccination and were followed up for 48 weeks. Primary safety and tolerability endpoints were assessed in all vaccine recipients by reactogenicity for the first 7 days, adverse events for the first 28 days, and serious adverse events throughout the study. Secondary immunogenicity endpoints included evaluation of binding antibody and T-cell responses against the Sudan Ebola virus glycoprotein, and neutralising antibody responses against the cAd3 vector at 4 weeks after vaccination. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04041570, and is completed. FINDINGS: 40 healthy adults were enrolled between July 22 and Oct 1, 2019, with 20 receiving 1 x 10(10) PU and 20 receiving 1 x 10(11) PU of cAd3-EBO S. 38 (95%) participants completed all follow-up visits. The cAd3-EBO S vaccine was well tolerated with no severe adverse events. The most common reactogenicity symptoms were pain or tenderness at the injection site (34 [85%] of 40), fatigue (29 [73%] of 40), and headache (26 [65%] of 40), and were mild to moderate in severity. Positive responses for glycoprotein-specific binding antibodies were induced by 2 weeks in 31 (78%) participants, increased to 34 (85%) participants by 4 weeks, and persisted to 48 weeks in 31 (82%) participants. Most participants developed glycoprotein-specific T-cell responses (20 [59%, 95% CI 41-75] of 34; six participants were removed from the T cell analysis after failing quality control parameters) by 4 weeks after vaccination, and neutralising titres against the cAd3 vector were also increased from baseline (90% inhibitory concentration of 47, 95% CI 30-73) to 4 weeks after vaccination (196, 125-308). INTERPRETATION: The cAd3-EBO S vaccine was safe at both doses, rapidly inducing immune responses in most participants after a single injection. The rapid onset and durability of the vaccine-induced antibodies make this vaccine a strong candidate for emergency deployment in Sudan Ebola virus outbreaks. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health via interagency agreement with Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

37559741|t|Ebola vaccine uptake and attitudes among healthcare workers in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2021.
37559741|a|INTRODUCTION: During the 2018-2020 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), prevention and control measures, such as Ebola vaccination were challenging by community mistrust. We aimed to understand perceptions regarding Ebola vaccination and identify determinants of Ebola vaccine uptake among HCWs. METHODS: In March 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among 438 HCWs from 100 randomly selected health facilities in three health zones (Butembo, Beni, Mabalako) affected by the 10th EVD outbreak in North Kivu, DRC. HCWs were eligible if they were >/= 18 years and were working in a health facility during the outbreak. We used survey logistic regression to assess correlates of first-offer uptake (i.e., having received the vaccine the first time it was offered vs. after subsequent offers). RESULTS: Of the 438 HCWs enrolled in the study, 420 (95.8%) reported that they were eligible and offered an Ebola vaccine. Among those offered vaccination, self-reported uptake of the Ebola vaccine was 99.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) [98.5-99.4]), but first-offer uptake was 70.2% (95% CI [67.1, 73.5]). Nearly all HCWs (94.3%; 95% CI [92.7-95.5]) perceived themselves to be at risk of contracting EVD. The most common concern was that the vaccine would cause side effects (65.7%; 95% CI [61.4-69.7]). In the multivariable analysis, mistrust of the vaccine source or how the vaccine was produced decreased the odds of first-time uptake. DISCUSSION: Overall uptake of the Ebola vaccine was high among HCWs, but uptake at the first offer was substantially lower, which was associated with mistrust of the vaccine source. Future Ebola vaccination efforts should plan to make repeated vaccination offers to HCWs and address their underlying mistrust in the vaccines, which can, in turn, improve community uptake.

37562033|t|An Antiviral Role for TRIM14 in Ebola Virus Infection.
37562033|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) is a highly pathogenic virus that encodes 7 multifunctional structural proteins. Multiple host factors have been reported to interact with the EBOV proteins. Here, we found that tripartite motif-containing 14 (TRIM14), an interferon-stimulated gene that mediates cellular signaling pathways associated with type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine production, interacts with EBOV nucleoprotein to enhance interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) promotor activation. Moreover, TRIM14 overexpression reduced viral replication in an infectious but biologically contained EBOVDeltaVP30 system by approximately 10-fold without affecting viral protein expression. Furthermore, TRM14-deficient mice were more susceptible to mouse-adapted EBOV infection than wild-type mice. Our data suggest that TRIM14 is a host factor with anti-EBOV activity that limits EBOV pathogenesis.

37598728|t|Disruption of Ebola NP(0)VP35 Inclusion Body-like Structures reduce Viral Infection.
37598728|a|Viral inclusion bodies (IBs) are potential sites of viral replication and assembly. How viral IBs form remains poorly defined. Here we describe a combined biophysical and cellular approach to identify the components necessary for IB formation during Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. We find that the eNP(0)VP35 complex containing Ebola nucleoprotein (eNP) and viral protein 35 (eVP35), the functional equivalents of nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) in non-segmented negative strand viruses (NNSVs), phase separates to form inclusion bodies. Phase separation of eNP(0)VP35 is reversible and modulated by ionic strength. The multivalency of eVP35, and not eNP, is also critical for phase separation. Furthermore, overexpression of an eVP35 peptide disrupts eNP(0)VP35 complex formation, leading to reduced frequency of IB formation and limited viral infection. Together, our results show that upon EBOV infection, the eNP(0)VP35 complex forms the minimum unit to drive IB formation and viral replication.

37654044|t|Interplay of Ebola Virus With Immune Cells Leading to Their Death by Diverse Mechanisms.
37654044|a|Inflammation and cytopenia are commonly observed during Ebola virus (EBOV) infection; however, mechanisms responsible for EBOV-induced cell death remain obscure. While apoptosis and necrosis are already identified as mechanisms of cell death induced by the virus, our study demonstrates that THP-1 monocytes and SupT1 T cells exposed to EBOV undergo pyroptosis and necroptosis, respectively, through a direct contact with EBOV, and also mediate pyroptosis or necroptosis of uninfected bystander cells via indirect effects associated with secreted soluble factors. These results emphasize novel aspects of interactions between EBOV and immune cell populations and provide a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of EBOV disease.

37656725|t|Low seroprevalence of Ebola virus in health care providers in an endemic region (Tshuapa province) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
37656725|a|INTRODUCTION: A serosurvey among health care providers (HCPs) and frontliners of an area previously affected by Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was conducted to assess the seroreactivity to Ebola virus antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected in a cohort of HCPs and frontliners (n = 698) participants in the EBL2007 vaccine trial (December 2019 to October 2022). Specimens seroreactive for EBOV were confirmed using either the Filovirus Animal Nonclinical Group (FANG) ELISA or a Luminex multiplex assay. RESULTS: The seroreactivity to at least two EBOV-Mayinga (m) antigens was found in 10 (1.4%: 95% CI, 0.7-2.6) samples for GP-EBOV-m + VP40-EBOV-m, and 2 (0.3%: 95% CI, 0.0-1.0) samples for VP40-EBOV-m + NP-EBOV-m using the Luminex assay. Seroreactivity to GP-EBOV-Kikwit (k) was observed in 59 (8.5%: 95%CI, 6.5-10.9) samples using FANG ELISA. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous serosurveys, a low seroprevalence was found in the HCP and frontline population participating in the EBL2007 Ebola vaccine trial in Boende, DRC. This underscores the high need for standardized antibody assays and cutoffs in EBOV serosurveys to avoid the broad range of reported EBOV seroprevalence rates in EBOV endemic areas.

37661067|t|Antibody responses to recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebolavirus vaccination for Ebola virus disease across doses and continents: 5-year durability.
37661067|a|OBJECTIVES: To report 5-year persistence and avidity of antibodies produced by the live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing the Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP), known as rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo(R)). METHODS: Healthy adults vaccinated with 300,000 or 10-50 million plaque-forming units of rVSV-ZEBOV in the WHO-coordinated trials of 2014-2015 were followed for up to 4 (Lambarene, Gabon) and 5 (Geneva, Switzerland) years. We report seropositivity rates, geometric mean titres (GMTs), and population distribution of ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization) and antibody avidity; the primary outcome was ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG GMTs at 4 or 5 years compared with 1 year (Y1) after immunization. RESULTS: Among the 168 eligible vaccinees (Geneva: 97 and Lambarene: 71) enrolled 1 year post-immunization, 146 (87%) remained enrolled at 4 years (Geneva: n = 88, Lambarene: n = 58), and 84 (87%, Geneva) at 5 years post-vaccination. ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG GMTs plateaued, with no declining trend from 1 year through the last time point assessed (1147.8 [95% CI 874.3-1507.0] at Y1 versus 1548.1 [95% CI 1136.6-2108.5] at Y5 in Geneva volunteers receiving >/=10 million plaque-forming units of rVSV-ZEBOV), their avidity matching that of ZEBOV convalescents. Live-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected for shorter periods and in fewer vaccinees (53/95 [56%] at Y1 versus 35/84 [42%] at Y5 in Geneva volunteers, all dose levels). DISCUSSION: Titres at Y1 emerged as a correlate of antibody persistence at Y5. The findings of persistent ZEBOV-GP ELISA IgG titres yet shorter-lasting, lower titres of live-virus neutralizing antibodies suggest the contribution of antibody-mediated protective mechanisms other than neutralization. Long-term clinical efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV, however, requires further study.

37691146|t|Identification of early gene expression profiles associated with long-lasting antibody responses to the Ebola vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo.
37691146|a|Ebola virus disease is a severe hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate. We investigate transcriptome profiles at 3 h, 1 day, and 7 days after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo. 3 h after Ad26.ZEBOV injection, we observe an increase in genes related to antigen presentation, sensing, and T and B cell receptors. The highest response occurs 1 day after Ad26.ZEBOV injection, with an increase of the gene expression of interferon-induced antiviral molecules, monocyte activation, and sensing receptors. This response is regulated by the HESX1, ATF3, ANKRD22, and ETV7 transcription factors. A plasma cell signature is observed on day 7 post-Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination, with an increase of CD138, MZB1, CD38, CD79A, and immunoglobulin genes. We have identified early expressed genes correlated with the magnitude of the antibody response 21 days after the MVA-BN-Filo and 364 days after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccinations. Our results provide early gene signatures that correlate with vaccine-induced Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies.

37723997|t|Ebola Virus Uses Tunneling Nanotubes as an Alternate Route of Dissemination.
37723997|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) disease is marked by rapid virus replication and spread. EBOV enters the cell by macropinocytosis and replicates in the cytoplasm, and nascent virions egress from the cell surface to infect neighboring cells. Here, we show that EBOV uses an alternate route to disseminate: tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). TNTs, an actin-based long-range intercellular communication system, allows for direct exchange of cytosolic constituents between cells. Using live, scanning electron, and high-resolution quantitative 3-dimensional microscopy, we show that EBOV infection of primary human cells results in the enhanced formation of TNTs containing viral nucleocapsids. TNTs promote the intercellular transfer of nucleocapsids in the absence of live virus, and virus could replicate in cells devoid of entry factors after initial stall. Our studies suggest an alternate model of EBOV dissemination within the host, laying the groundwork for further investigations into the pathogenesis of filoviruses and, importantly, stimulating new areas of antiviral design.

37727795|t|Persistence of immunological memory as a potential correlate of long-term, vaccine-induced protection against Ebola virus disease in humans.
37727795|a|INTRODUCTION: In the absence of clinical efficacy data, vaccine protective effect can be extrapolated from animals to humans, using an immunological biomarker in humans that correlates with protection in animals, in a statistical approach called immunobridging. Such an immunobridging approach was previously used to infer the likely protective effect of the heterologous two-dose Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen. However, this immunobridging model does not provide information on how the persistence of the vaccine-induced immune response relates to durability of protection in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: In both humans and non-human primates, vaccine-induced circulating antibody levels appear to be very stable after an initial phase of contraction and are maintained for at least 3.8 years in humans (and at least 1.3 years in non-human primates). Immunological memory was also maintained over this period, as shown by the kinetics and magnitude of the anamnestic response following re-exposure to the Ebola virus glycoprotein antigen via booster vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV in humans. In non-human primates, immunological memory was also formed as shown by an anamnestic response after high-dose, intramuscular injection with Ebola virus, but was not sufficient for protection against Ebola virus disease at later timepoints due to a decline in circulating antibodies and the fast kinetics of disease in the non-human primates model. Booster vaccination within three days of subsequent Ebola virus challenge in non-human primates resulted in protection from Ebola virus disease, i.e. before the anamnestic response was fully developed. DISCUSSION: Humans infected with Ebola virus may benefit from the anamnestic response to prevent disease progression, as the incubation time is longer and progression of Ebola virus disease is slower as compared to non-human primates. Therefore, the persistence of vaccine-induced immune memory could be considered as a potential correlate of long-term protection against Ebola virus disease in humans, without the need for a booster.

37737753|t|Prevalence and Factors Related to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Depression Symptoms Among Children and Adolescents Survivors and Orphans of Ebola Virus Disease in Democratic Republic of the Congo Eastern Regions During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
37737753|a|PURPOSE: Although previous studies have shown a high prevalence of mental health problems among adult Ebola virus disease survivors, no studies have yet been conducted on mental health problems among children and adolescents in affected regions. Consequently, the current study aimed to examine the prevalence and factors associated with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among children and adolescent survivors and orphans by utilizing a cross-sectional survey following the 2018-2020 epidemic in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. METHODS: A total of 146 survivors (mean age = 13.62, standard deviation [SD] = 2.50, 49.32% female), 233 orphans (mean age = 13.18, SD = 2.96, 53.32% female), and 34 orphan-survivor participants (mean age = 13.39, SD = 2.87, 44.12% female) were recruited. Participants completed measures assessing depression and PTSD symptoms, traumatic experiences, and stigma related to Ebola and COVID-19. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and PTSD symptoms was 87.32% and 44.42%, respectively. Results showed significant differences in depression and PTSD symptoms between orphan-survivors (100% and 97.06%), survivors (90.21% and 75.86%), and orphans (83.48% and 16.52%; chi(2)(2) = 9.02; p = .011 and chi(2)(2) = 168.85; p < .001). Experience of traumatic events, Ebola stigmatization, and COVID-19 stigmatization positively predicted depression and PTSD symptoms. The regression models explained 61%-72% of the variance of depression and PTSD. DISCUSSION: The results reveal that the Ebola virus disease and its associated grief severely jeopardize the mental health of children and adolescents in affected regions. Despite the relative paucity of resources, intervention programs may be helpful to minimize associated stigma and promote psychological support.

37787119|t|Recombinant Sudan virus and evaluation of humoral cross-reactivity between Ebola and Sudan virus glycoproteins after infection or rVSV-DeltaG-ZEBOV-GP vaccination.
37787119|a|Ebola disease outbreaks are major public health events because of human-to-human transmission and high mortality. These outbreaks are most often caused by Ebola virus, but at least three related viruses can also cause the disease. In 2022, Sudan virus re-emerged causing more than 160 confirmed and probable cases. This report describes generation of a recombinant Sudan virus and demonstrates its utility by quantifying antibody cross-reactivity between Ebola and Sudan virus glycoproteins after human infection or vaccination with a licensed Ebola virus vaccine.

37834238|t|Novel Antiviral Molecules against Ebola Virus Infection.
37834238|a|Infection with Ebola virus (EBOV) is responsible for hemorrhagic fever in humans with a high mortality rate. Combined efforts of prevention and therapeutic intervention are required to tackle highly variable RNA viruses, whose infections often lead to outbreaks. Here, we have screened the 2P2I(3D) chemical library using a nanoluciferase-based protein complementation assay (NPCA) and isolated two compounds that disrupt the interaction of the EBOV protein fragment VP35IID with the N-terminus of the dsRNA-binding proteins PKR and PACT, involved in IFN response and/or intrinsic immunity, respectively. The two compounds inhibited EBOV infection in cell culture as well as infection by measles virus (MV) independently of IFN induction. Consequently, we propose that the compounds are antiviral by restoring intrinsic immunity driven by PACT. Given that PACT is highly conserved across mammals, our data support further testing of the compounds in other species, as well as against other negative-sense RNA viruses.

37839549|t|Ebola virus VP35 perturbs type I interferon signaling to facilitate viral replication.
37839549|a|As one of the deadliest viruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) causes lethal hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates. The suppression of innate immunity leads to robust systemic virus replication of EBOV, leading to enhanced transmission. However, the mechanism of EBOV-host interaction is not fully understood. Here, we identified multiple dysregulated genes in early stage of EBOV infection through transcriptomic analysis, which are highly clustered to Jak-STAT signaling. EBOV VP35 and VP30 were found to inhibit type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Moreover, exogenous expression of VP35 blocks the phosphorylation of endogenous STAT1, and suppresses nuclear translocation of STAT1. Using serial truncated mutations of VP35, N-terminal 1-220 amino acid residues of VP35 were identified to be essential for blocking on type I IFN signaling. Remarkably, VP35 of EBOV suppresses type I IFN signaling more efficiently than those of Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) and Marburg virus (MARV), resulting in stable replication to facilitate the pathogenesis. Altogether, this study enriches understanding on EBOV evasion of innate immune response, and provides insights into the interplay between filoviruses and host.

37847703|t|Cost-effectiveness of incorporating Ebola prediction score tools and rapid diagnostic tests into a screening algorithm: A decision analytic model.
37847703|a|BACKGROUND: No distinctive clinical signs of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have prompted the development of rapid screening tools or called for a new approach to screening suspected Ebola cases. New screening approaches require evidence of clinical benefit and economic efficiency. As of now, no evidence or defined algorithm exists. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, from a healthcare perspective, the efficiency of incorporating Ebola prediction scores and rapid diagnostic tests into the EVD screening algorithm during an outbreak. METHODS: We collected data on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and prediction scores' accuracy measurements, e.g., sensitivity and specificity, and the cost of case management and RDT screening in EVD suspect cases. The overall cost of healthcare services (PPE, procedure time, and standard-of-care (SOC) costs) per suspected patient and diagnostic confirmation of EVD were calculated. We also collected the EVD prevalence among suspects from the literature. We created an analytical decision model to assess the efficiency of eight screening strategies: 1) Screening suspect cases with the WHO case definition for Ebola suspects, 2) Screening suspect cases with the ECPS at -3 points of cut-off, 3) Screening suspect cases with the ECPS as a joint test, 4) Screening suspect cases with the ECPS as a conditional test, 5) Screening suspect cases with the WHO case definition, then QuickNavi-Ebola RDT, 6) Screening suspect cases with the ECPS at -3 points of cut-off and QuickNavi-Ebola RDT, 7) Screening suspect cases with the ECPS as a conditional test and QuickNavi-Ebola RDT, and 8) Screening suspect cases with the ECPS as a joint test and QuickNavi-Ebola RDT. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to identify an algorithm that minimizes the cost per patient correctly classified. We performed a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings. RESULTS: Our analysis found dual ECPS as a conditional test with the QuickNavi-Ebola RDT algorithm to be the most cost-effective screening algorithm for EVD, with an effectiveness of 0.86. The cost-effectiveness ratio was 106.7 USD per patient correctly classified. The following algorithms, the ECPS as a conditional test with an effectiveness of 0.80 and an efficiency of 111.5 USD per patient correctly classified and the ECPS as a joint test with the QuickNavi-Ebola RDT algorithm with an effectiveness of 0.81 and a cost-effectiveness ratio of 131.5 USD per patient correctly classified. These findings were sensitive to variations in the prevalence of EVD in suspected population and the sensitivity of the QuickNavi-Ebola RDT. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study showed that prediction scores and RDT could improve Ebola screening. The use of the ECPS as a conditional test algorithm and the dual ECPS as a conditional test and then the QuickNavi-Ebola RDT algorithm are the best screening choices because they are more efficient and lower the number of confirmation tests and overall care costs during an EBOV epidemic.

37848269|t|The cost of public health interventions to respond to the 10th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
37848269|a|The 10th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) drew substantial attention from the international community, which in turn invested more than US$1 billion in EVD control over two years (2018-2020). This is the first EVD outbreak to take place in a conflict area, which led to a shift in strategy from a pure public health response (PHR) to a multisectoral humanitarian response. A wide range of disease control and mitigation activities were implemented and were outlined in the five budgeted Strategic Response Plans used throughout the 26 months. This study used the budget/expenditure and output indicators for disease control and mitigation interventions compiled by the government of DRC and development and humanitarian partners to estimate unit costs of key Ebola control interventions. Of all the investment in EVD control, 68% was spent on PHR. The remaining 32% covered security, community support interventions for the PHR. The disbursement for the public health pillar was distributed as follows: (1) coordination (18.8%), (2), clinical management of EVD cases (18.4%), (3) surveillance and vaccination (15.9%), (4) infection prevention and control/WASH (13.8%) and (5) risk communication (13.7%). The unit costs of key EVD control interventions were as follows: US$66 182 for maintaining a rapid response team per month, US$4435 for contact tracing and surveillance per identified EVD case, US$1464 for EVD treatment per case, US$59.4 per EVD laboratory test, US$120.7 per vaccinated individual against EVD and US$175.0 for mental health and psychosocial support per beneficiary. The estimated unit costs of key EVD disease control interventions provide crucial information for future infectious disease control planning and budgeting, as well as prioritisation of disease control interventions.

37858466|t|Blocking of ebolavirus spread through intercellular connections by an MPER-specific antibody depends on BST2/tetherin.
37858466|a|Ebola virus (EBOV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) belong to the family Filoviridae and cause a severe disease in humans. We previously isolated a large panel of monoclonal antibodies from B cells of human survivors from the 2007 Uganda BDBV outbreak, 16 survivors from the 2014 EBOV outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and one survivor from the West African 2013-2016 EBOV epidemic. Here, we demonstrate that EBOV and BDBV are capable of spreading to neighboring cells through intercellular connections in a process that depends upon actin and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin 1 protein. We quantify spread through intercellular connections by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. One of the antibodies, BDBV223, specific to the membrane-proximal external region, induces virus accumulation at the plasma membrane. The inhibiting activity of BDBV223 depends on BST2/tetherin.

37858585|t|Safety and immunogenicity of the two-dose heterologous Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen in infants: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial in Guinea and Sierra Leone.
37858585|a|BACKGROUND: This study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine regimen in infants aged 4-11 months in Guinea and Sierra Leone. METHODS: In this phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy infants (1:1 in a sentinel cohort, 5:2 for the remaining infants via an interactive web response system) to receive Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo (Ebola vaccine group) or two doses of meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (control group) administered 56 days apart. Infants were recruited at two sites in west Africa: Conakry, Guinea, and Kambia, Sierra Leone. All infants received the meningococcal vaccine 8 months after being randomly assigned. The primary objective was safety. The secondary objective was immunogenicity, measured as EBOV glycoprotein-binding antibody concentration 21 days post-dose 2, using the Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group ELISA. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03929757) and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201905827924069). FINDINGS: From Aug 20 to Nov 29, 2019, 142 infants were screened and 108 were randomly assigned (Ebola vaccine n=75; control n=33). The most common solicited local adverse event was injection-site pain (Ebola vaccine 15 [20%] of 75; control four [12%] of 33). The most common solicited systemic adverse events with the Ebola vaccine were irritability (26 [35%] of 75), decreased appetite (18 [24%] of 75), pyrexia (16 [21%] of 75), and decreased activity (15 [20%] of 75). In the control group, ten (30%) of 33 had irritability, seven (21%) of 33 had decreased appetite, three (9%) of 33 had pyrexia, and five (15%) of 33 had decreased activity. The frequency of unsolicited adverse events was 83% (62 of 75 infants) in the Ebola vaccine group and 85% (28 of 33 infants) in the control group. No serious adverse events were vaccine-related. In the Ebola vaccine group, EBOV glycoprotein-binding antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at 21 days post-dose 2 were 27 700 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95% CI 20 477-37 470) in infants aged 4-8 months and 20 481 EU/mL (15 325-27 372) in infants aged 9-11 months. The responder rate was 100% (74 of 74 responded). In the control group, GMCs for both age groups were less than the lower limit of quantification and the responder rate was 3% (one of 33 responded). INTERPRETATION: Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo was well tolerated and induced strong humoral responses in infants younger than 1 year. There were no safety concerns related to vaccination.

37880247|t|Identification of CCZ1 as an essential lysosomal trafficking regulator in Marburg and Ebola virus infections.
37880247|a|Marburg and Ebola filoviruses are two of the deadliest infectious agents and several outbreaks have occurred in the last decades. Although several receptors and co-receptors have been reported for Ebola virus, key host factors remain to be elucidated. In this study, using a haploid cell screening platform, we identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor CCZ1 as a key host factor in the early stage of filovirus replication. The critical role of CCZ1 for filovirus infections is validated in 3D primary human hepatocyte cultures and human blood-vessel organoids, both critical target sites for Ebola and Marburg virus tropism. Mechanistically, CCZ1 controls early to late endosomal trafficking of these viruses. In addition, we report that CCZ1 has a role in the endosomal trafficking of endocytosis-dependent SARS-CoV-2 infections, but not in infections by Lassa virus, which enters endo-lysosomal trafficking at the late endosome stage. Thus, we have identified an essential host pathway for filovirus infections in cell lines and engineered human target tissues. Inhibition of CCZ1 nearly completely abolishes Marburg and Ebola infections. Thus, targeting CCZ1 could potentially serve as a promising drug target for controlling infections caused by various viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, Marburg, and Ebola.

37880607|t|Documenting the development, adoption and pre-ebola implementation of Liberia's integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) strategy.
37880607|a|BACKGROUND: In the immediate aftermath of a 14-year civil conflict that disrupted the health system, Liberia adopted the internationally recommended integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) strategy in 2004. Despite this, Liberia was among the three West African countries ravaged by the worst Ebola epidemic in history from 2014 to 2016. This paper describes successes, failures, strengths, and weaknesses in the development, adoption, and implementation of IDSR following the civil war and up until the outbreak of Ebola, from 2004 to early 2014. METHODS: We reviewed 112 official Government documents and peer-reviewed articles and conducted 29 in-depth interviews with key informants from December 2021 to March 2022 to gain perspectives on IDSR in the post-conflict and pre-Ebola era in Liberia. We assessed the core and supportive functions of IDSR, such as notification of priority diseases, confirmation, reporting, analysis, investigation, response, feedback, monitoring, staff training, supervision, communication, and financial resources. Data were triangulated and presented via emerging themes and in-depth accounts to describe the context of IDSR introduction and implementation, and the barriers surrounding it. RESULTS: Despite the adoption of the IDSR framework, Liberia failed to secure the resources-human, logistical, and financial-to support effective implementation over the 10-year period. Documents and interview reports demonstrate numerous challenges prior to Ebola: the surveillance system lacked key components of IDSR including laboratory testing capacity, disease reporting, risk communication, community engagement, and staff supervision systems. Insufficient financial support and an abundance of vertical programs further impeded progress. In-depth accounts by donors and key governmental informants demonstrate that although the system had a role in detecting Ebola in Liberia, it could not respond effectively to control the disease. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that post-war, Liberia's health system intended to prioritize epidemic preparedness and response with the adoption of IDSR. However, insufficient investment and systems development meant IDSR was not well implemented, leaving the country vulnerable to the devastating impact of the Ebola epidemic.

37896854|t|Effect of Interferon Gamma on Ebola Virus Infection of Primary Kupffer Cells and a Kupffer Cell Line.
37896854|a|Ebola virus disease (EVD) represents a global health threat. The etiological agents of EVD are six species of Orthoebolaviruses, with Orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) having the greatest public health and medical significance. EVD pathogenesis occurs as a result of broad cellular tropism of the virus, robust viral replication and a potent and dysregulated production of cytokines. In vivo, tissue macrophages are some of the earliest cells infected and contribute significantly to virus load and cytokine production. While EBOV is known to infect macrophages and to generate high titer virus in the liver, EBOV infection of liver macrophages, Kupffer cells, has not previously been examined in tissue culture or experimentally manipulated in vivo. Here, we employed primary murine Kupffer cells (KC) and an immortalized murine Kupffer cell line (ImKC) to assess EBOV-eGFP replication in liver macrophages. KCs and ImKCs were highly permissive for EBOV infection and IFN-gamma polarization of these cells suppressed their permissiveness to infection. The kinetics of IFN-gamma-elicited antiviral responses were examined using a biologically contained model of EBOV infection termed EBOV DeltaVP30. The antiviral activity of IFN-gamma was transient, but a modest ~3-fold reduction of infection persisted for as long as 6 days post-treatment. To assess the interferon-stimulated gene products (ISGs) responsible for protection, the efficacy of secreted ISGs induced by IFN-gamma was evaluated and secreted ISGs failed to block EBOV DeltaVP30. Our studies define new cellular tools for the study of EBOV infection that can potentially aid the development of new antiviral therapies. Furthermore, our data underscore the importance of macrophages in EVD pathogenesis and those IFN-gamma-elicited ISGs that help to control EBOV infection.

37938974|t|The evolution and determinants of neutralization of potent head-binding antibodies against Ebola virus.
37938974|a|Monoclonal antibodies against the Ebola virus (EBOV) surface glycoprotein are effective treatments for EBOV disease. Antibodies targeting the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) head epitope have potent neutralization and Fc effector function activity and thus are of high interest as therapeutics and for vaccine design. Here we focus on the head-binding antibodies 1A2 and 1D5, which have been identified previously in a longitudinal study of survivors of EBOV infection. 1A2 and 1D5 have the same heavy- and light-chain germlines despite being isolated from different individuals and at different time points after recovery from infection. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of each antibody in complex with the EBOV surface GP reveals key amino acid substitutions in 1A2 that contribute to greater affinity, improved neutralization potency, and enhanced breadth as well as two strategies for antibody evolution from a common site.

37981473|t|Safety and immunogenicity of an Ad26.ZEBOV booster vaccine in Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive (HIV+) adults previously vaccinated with the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen against Ebola: A single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial in Kenya and Uganda.
37981473|a|BACKGROUND: People living with HIV constitute an important part of the population in regions at risk of Ebola virus disease outbreaks. The two-dose Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen induces strong immune responses in HIV-positive (HIV+) adults but the durability of this response is unknown. It is also unclear whether this regimen can establish immune memory to enable an anamnestic response upon re-exposure to antigen. METHODS: This paper describes an open-label, phase 2 trial, conducted in Kenya and Uganda, of Ad26.ZEBOV booster vaccination in HIV+ participants who had previously received the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo primary regimen. HIV+ adults with well-controlled infection and on highly active antiretroviral therapy were enrolled, vaccinated with booster, and followed for 28 days. The primary objectives were to assess Ad26.ZEBOV booster safety and antibody responses against the Ebola virus glycoprotein using the Filovirus Animal Non-Clinical Group ELISA. RESULTS: The Ad26.ZEBOV booster was well-tolerated in HIV+ adults with mostly mild to moderate symptoms. No major safety concerns or serious adverse events were reported. Four and a half years after the primary regimen, 24/26 (92 %) participants were still classified as responders, with a pre-booster antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 726 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95 %CI 447-1179). Seven days after the booster, the GMC increased 54-fold to 38,965 EU/mL (95 %CI 23532-64522). Twenty-one days after the booster, the GMC increased 176-fold to 127,959 EU/mL (95 %CI 93872-174422). The responder rate at both post-booster time points was 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: The Ad26.ZEBOV booster is safe and highly immunogenic in HIV+ adults with well-controlled infection. The Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo regimen can generate long-term immune memory persisting for at least 4.5 years, resulting in a robust anamnestic response.

37992432|t|Stigmatization of Ebola virus disease survivors in 2022: A cross-sectional study of survivors in Sierra Leone.
37992432|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has demonstrated a high proportion of Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors experienced stigma due to the disease. This study sought to understand the longer-term effects of stigma encountered by survivors of the 2014-2016 EVD epidemic living in Sierra Leone. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 595 EVD survivors and 403 close contacts (n = 998) from Sierra Leone. Assessments were conducted using a three-part survey between November 2021 to March 2022. We explored the socio-demographic factors associated with stigma experienced by EVD survivors. FINDINGS: 50.6 % (n = 301) of EVD survivors reported that they continued to experience at least one aspect of stigma. Females were disproportionately affected by stigma, with 45.2 % of females reporting isolation from friends and family compared to 33.9 % of men (p = 0.005). Multivariable logistic regression models revealed those aged 40-44, living rurally, and reporting an acute infection longer than seven days was associated with EVD-related stigma at the time of survey. INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates stigma is still prevalent among people who survived EVD in 2022. It also identified socio-demographic factors associated with stigma that can be used for targeting interventions. Importantly, this highlights the continued need for EVD survivors to access mental healthcare and social support systems well after disease recovery.

38020355|t|Evaluation of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance performance before and during the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak in Guinea and Liberia.
38020355|a|INTRODUCTION: the number of wild poliomyelitis cases, worldwide, dropped from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 33 in 2018. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is a key strategy toward achieving global polio eradication. The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa infected over 28,000 people and had devastating effects on health systems in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. We sought to assess the effects of the 2014 Ebola outbreak on AFP surveillance in Guinea and Liberia. METHODS: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed for Guinea and Liberia to evaluate EVD s impact on World Health Organization (WHO) AFP surveillance performance indicators during 2012-2015. RESULTS: both Guinea and Liberia met the WHO target non-polio AFP incidence rate nationally, and generally sub-nationally, prior to the EVD outbreak; rates decreased substantially during the outbreak in seven of eight regions in Guinea and 11 of 15 counties in Liberia. Throughout the study period, both Guinea and Liberia attained appropriate overall targets nationally for "notification" and "stool adequacy" indicators, but each country experienced periods of poor regional/county-specific indicator performance. CONCLUSION: these findings mirrored the negative effect of the Ebola outbreak on polio elimination activities in both countries and highlights the need to reinforce this surveillance system during times of crisis.

38035334|t|Extracellular vesicle storm during the course of Ebola virus infection in primates.
38035334|a|INTRODUCTION: Ebola virus (EBOV) is an RNA virus of the Filoviridae family that is responsible for outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers in primates with a lethality rate as high as 90%. EBOV primarily targets host macrophages leading to cell activation and systemic cytokine storm, and fatal infection is associated with an inhibited interferon response, and lymphopenia. The EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP) has been shown to directly induce T cell depletion and can be secreted outside the virion via extracellular vesicles (EVs), though most studies are limited to epithelial cells and underlying mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. METHODS: To assess the role of GP on EBOV-induced dysregulation of host immunity, we first utilized EBOV virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing VP40 and NP either alone (Bald-VLP) or in conjunction with GP (VLP-GP) to investigate early inflammatory responses in THP-1 macrophages and in a murine model. We then sought to decipher the role of non-classical inflammatory mediators such as EVs over the course of EBOV infection in two EBOV-infected rhesus macaques by isolating and characterizing circulatory EVs throughout disease progression using size exclusion chromatography, nanoparticle tracking-analysis, and LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: While all VLPs could induce inflammatory mediators and recruit small peritoneal macrophages, pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression was exacerbated by the presence of GP. Further, quantification of EVs isolated from infected rhesus macaques revealed that the concentration of vesicles peaked in circulation at the terminal stage, at which time EBOV GP could be detected in host-derived exosomes. Moreover, comparative proteomics conducted across EV populations isolated from serum at various time points before and after infection revealed differences in host-derived protein content that were most significantly pronounced at the endpoint of infection, including significant expression of mediators of TLR4 signaling. DISCUSSION: These results suggest a dynamic role for EVs in the modification of disease states in the context of EBOV. Overall, our work highlights the importance of viral factors, such as the GP, and host derived EVs in the inflammatory cascade and pathogenesis of EBOV, which can be collectively further exploited for novel antiviral development.

38049815|t|Performance of a safe and dignified burial intervention during an Ebola epidemic in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2018-2019.
38049815|a|BACKGROUND: A protracted Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in the eastern Ituri, North and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) caused 3470 confirmed and probable cases between July 2018 and April 2020. During the epidemic, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) supported the DRC Red Cross and other local actors to offer safe and dignified burials (SDB) for suspected and confirmed EVD cases, so as to reduce transmission associated with infectious dead bodies. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the SDB service's performance in order to inform future applications of this intervention. METHODS: We analysed data on individual SDB responses to quantify performance based on key indicators and against pre-specified service standards. Specifically, we defined SDB timeliness as response within 24 h and success as all components of the service being implemented. Combining the database with other information sources, we also fit generalised linear mixed binomial models to explore factors associated with unsuccessful SDB. RESULTS: Out of 14,624 requests for SDB, 99% were responded to, 89% within 24 h. Overall, 61% of SDBs were successful, somewhat below target (80%), with failures clustered during a high-insecurity period. Factors associated with increased odds of unsuccessful SDB included reported community and/or family nonacceptance, insecurity and suspensions of the EVD response, low health facility coverage and high coverage of radio and telephony. Burials supported by mobile Civil Protection (local authorities) and/or static, community-based 'harm reduction' teams were associated with lower odds of failure. CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale, timely and moderately performant SDB service proved feasible during the challenging eastern DRC EVD response. Burial teams that are managed by community actors and operate locally, and supported rather than owned by 

38053102|t|Understanding knowledge, attitudes and practices on Ebola Virus Disease: a multi-site mixed methods survey on preparedness in Rwanda.
38053102|a|BACKGROUND: The overall goal of this survey was to understand the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Rwanda. METHODS: This mixed-method cross-sectional survey was conducted in five selected districts of Rwanda. Quantitative data were collected from 1,010 participants using Kobo Collect Software and the analysis was performed using SPSS and Python software. Qualitative data were specifically collected from 98 participants through Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and Focus Group Discussion (FGDs). Interview transcripts were imported into NVIVO 8 for coding and subsequent analysis. RESULTS: As per our quantitative findings, we report that from the 1,010 respondents, 99.6% reported having previously heard of Ebola, 97.2% believed that vaccination is important in combatting the disease and 93.3% of individuals reported a willingness to receive vaccination should one become available. Around 54% of the respondents were correct in identifying that the disease is of a viral origin which originates from wild animals (42.1%). When asked if they believed that Rwanda is at risk of an EVD outbreak, 90% of the respondents believe that the country is at risk of an EVD outbreak, and the cofactors *gender* and *whether people dwell in Rubavu/Rusizi* were found to significantly impact their perception of threat. As per our qualitative findings, the respondents mentioned that both geographical proximity and relations with the Democratic Republic of Congo place Rwanda at risk of developing an internal outbreak. Although the respondents seemed to be aware of the Ebola prevention behaviours, it was noted that some of them will require significant time before reintegrating into the community an EVD survivor, as they will first need assurance that the patient has fully recovered. Therefore, the qualitative findings reinforce what we originally reported in the quantitative approach to this study. CONCLUSION: Our results show that there was high EVD-related knowledge and awareness among the general population in Rwanda. However, for strong public health awareness, preparedness, and protection, a massive investment should always be made in education about EVD with a special focus on districts neighboring countries where the disease is consistently being reported.

38112249|t|Immunogenicity and safety of ebolavirus vaccines in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
38112249|a|BACKGROUND: This review aimed to systematically evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the candidate Ebola virus vaccine (EVV). METHODS: We searched five databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of EVV on healthy adults. The primary outcomes were relative risk (RR) of sero-conversion or sero-response of EVV in healthy adults between the groups that received EVV and the controls. RESULTS: Twenty-nine RCTs (n = 23573) were included. There was a significant difference in RR of sero-conversion of EVV (RR 13.18; 95% CI 11.28-15.41; I(2) = 33%; P < 0.01) between the two groups. There was a significant difference in RR of adverse events (AEs) of EVV (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.27-1.74; I(2) = 88%; P < 0.01), although no difference in RR of serious AE (SAE) between the two groups. Subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant difference in RR of AEs for DNAEBO, EBOV-GP, MVA, and rVSVN4CT1 vaccines, compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: The DNAEBO, EBOV-GP, MVA, and rVSVN4CT1 vaccines are likely to be safe and immunogenic, tending to support the vaccination against Ebola disease. These findings should provide much-needed evidence for public health policy makers to develop preventive measures based on disease prevalence features and socio-economic conditions.
